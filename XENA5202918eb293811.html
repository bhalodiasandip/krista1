<P>Patient that deserved particular cares. It was true. There was an administrator, a certain doctor markham,<br>that continuava to ask questions on my case. Every day it came to thé sixth floor and it involved as<br>a bloodhound that smells thé prey. Î made him/it reassure from doctor hartman. Then î made him explain<br>thé matter from thé infermiera oldsmith. At thé end î renetrated in thé mind of markham and î reassured<br>him/it my way.But he was stubborn. Four days latter it returned and it started to ask questions to thé<br>nurse on thé extra services that were offered me, on who paid thé supplementary medicines, thé examinations,<br>thé tacs and thé specialistic visits. Markham underline that thé office amministrazione didnt have<br>my practice of acceptance, that you/they missed thé forms b, thé rintouts of thé extra expenses, details<br>on thé modalitàs of payment. Thé nurse oldsmith and doctor hartman accettarono to participate in thé<br>reunion with our investigator, thé direttore of thé hospital, thé head of thé office administration<br>and other three impiegatis. That evening î accompanied to house markham. Thé schuylkill expressway was<br>very trafficked and it made riaffiorare to thé mind thé ugly memoirs of thé night of new years eve.<br>just before to reach thé intersection with thé roosevelt expressway î forced our friend to stop thé<br>macchina on  narrow bench, î made him turn on thé lights of emergency and î incited him/it to put<br>on in front of thé chrysler. Î made him/it stay there to scratch him thé bald head while he/she was<br>wondering what it dident with thé car. Thé propitious instant came when thé five passages full of<br>cars started to flow fast. On thé inside passage a truck arrived.Our friend administrator made three<br>leaps. Î had thé time of sentire thé horn, to see thé expression shocked on does her/it some camionista<br>and to perceive thé incredulous thoughts of markham before impect hurled me toward other point of view.<br>of his/her dottorino. Thé time meant well few for me in that period. Î want on and back in thé time<br>with thé same facility with which î passed from a punto of sight to thé other. Î liked above all to<br>relive those summers trascorse in europe together with nina and to our new friend wilhelm. Î considered<br>to thé fresh summer evenings to which we want to î walk on thé ringstrasse, thé road to thé fashion<br>where you/they could be met all thé viennese that counted suits in great pomp. Willi always wanted to<br>go to thé colosseum cinema in nussdorferstrasse where davano always that boring films of propaganda<br>nazi, but nina and î often succeeded in convincing our young guide to bring us to thé kruger kino, where<br>they projected with regularity thé new films of american gangster. An evening me sbellicai from thé   <br>laughters to feel jimmy cagney that it spit words in german in thé firest film doubled that avessi ever<br>seen. After thé show we went to drink to thé reisscafe of kärntnerstrasse to unit us to thé other worldly<br>gruppettis in thé chic local relaxant with thé chairs of true skin and thé tables of marble with thé<br>gilded finishes. To give an illegitimate touch to thé evening, arrived at times, some prostitutas of<br>tall edge together with his/her last conquest done on thé vicina kruggerstrasse. We often close thé<br>evening from simple, thé most elegant cabaret in vienna. Thé complete name of thé place was simplicissimus,<br>and î perfectly remember that you/he/she was managed by two hebrews, karl frakas and fritz grunbaum.<br>even while thé brown shirts put to iron and fire thé roads of thé old city, that two cabarettistis they<br>made to crack dalle laughters thé customers with their satirical sketches that had as bersaglio two<br>nazis that made repetition figuracce during a social occasione or they discussed of fascist doctrine<br>while they were making thé nazi regard to thé dogs to thé cats and thé passersby. Î remember that willi<br>laughed to crepapelle up to thé tears. Once it risked to strangle him, so much that nina and î owed<br>give some pacches on his back and to offer him our champagne. A few years after thé war, during a delle<br>our reunions, willi said that frakas or grunbaun, dont remember who of thé two, it was dead in one of <br>thé fields that willi had amministrato before thé transfer on thé oriental font. Nina was very beautiful<br>in that period. Thé blonde hair fashion you/he/she was cut and you/he/she could afford, gives<br>thé inheritance to make to be sent thé miglioris lives of skill from paris. Î remember particularly<br>with thé very long skirt and thé bodice that it stuck to her small breasts one of it; thé green made<br>to jump marvelously its rosy complexion and thé blue occhis. Î dont remember who was to formally propose</P>
