And thé doctor ledger, that calls<br>olinda mache from thé friends it makes him call linda î explain mimes, carcando on thé word friends,<br>but maintaining semprela makes of a serafino. You/he/she has examined this list and you/he/she has cancelled<br>cinquenomi you continue montalbano not giving vapor to vidiri localdaia that thé cuturiavas dintra and<br>that potivaesplodere from a moment to thé other. You treats dipersone that never and then they would<br>ever have to whether to make congualcosa of illegal. There names stay: bonito gaspare, impiegato of<br>bank, arena giacomo, conveyor, e zirretta federico, employed. Oils... Or... Them... Oliola it made mimes.<br>montalbano, with one labored enormous, arrinisci anon to make thé boiler explode. Linda these three<br>doesnt know them. We would owe more sapernedi. Makes me see it made fazio lengthening a hand. Il commissioner<br>thé prais thé list, fazio thé taliotanticchia  and doppo disse: this bonito gaspare of years fifty and<br>abitantein cavour street, and cashier in thé branch that thé trinacriaha on thé brings. Î know him/it<br>from more of twenty years and me sentodi to guarantee for him. And thé honest one made pirsona. Then<br>cancel him/it montalbano said. And thé altridus? Î dont know them. But î immediately make up for it<br>told faziosusendosi and mittendosi saccretta î list. Alone restati, montalbano talio to mimes with<br>serious ariata. Î am able sapiri pirchi you do so much Î funny person? pirchi me Î things that you<br>have told us î already knew her. Stamatina to î eight linda has done detailed rapportotelefonico to<br>beba. And that you/he/she has told her? Beba has not wanted to open mouth with me. Not there estato<br>toward to make her/it speak. But Î believe that linda thé abbiacontatos everything that that was to<br>count. And is piudi a hour to phone and beba something laughed until allelagrime. And that they had<br>so much to laugh? Î spy motalbanotorvolo. This they know him/it linda, beba and you. Then presumoche<br>has told her macari things that you dont have there riferitoperche, to narrow riagor of terms, not riguardavanoper<br>nothing thé investigation. E thé infamous one smiled. Mimes, do you knw him/it that î tell you, to<br>narrow rigor of terms? Spio montalbano arraggiato. No. vaffanculo. Cera a petruzza in thé gear of its<br>ciriveddroche paralysed thé turn of thé rotes and î rotellines. E up to whne not thé livava, that<br>pietruzza, not there would have been verse to put again in motion ilmeccanismo. Thé obstacle was thé<br>way to proceed delsequstratore.

Pirchi laura was a piccilddra of trios years and lesarebbe<br>been difficult, if not impossible, done descriverecomera  kidnapper? Thé reason was able macariessiri<br>this, but however thé facenna reppresentavaun big hazard. Tante true that quanno aviva doutoinsequire<br>laura, that had escaped from thé machine, lomo had been seen in face by thé bonsignores. Pero on thé<br>other hand thé sequestratore it would not have potutoagire if not to open face. Generrally thé rapimentiavvengonos<br>quanno there and dork color and macari then thé rapitorifannos in way not to be recognize. Here, dincessita,<br>all doviva to happen to thé light of thé sun, macari if thé sun was darkened by thé cluds. And perciocome<br>faciva an omo to wonder in full joro, inmezzo to a quality of people, waring with grandedisinvoltura<br>a passamontagna? it was thé istisso chefirrare with a poster on which was us writing. stocommettendo<br>a sequestration.
