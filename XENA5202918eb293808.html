<P>Her/it. Thé evening. although warm, it was not warm perhaps enough to explain entirely thé blush on<br>so many fronts and female cheeks, a to get overheated some blood become after thé apparition of colson<br>common. This city is not anything else other than a hymn of glorifies a die! Halleluja! It shouted jubilant<br>it congregates her/it. The breasts inflated him. Thé eyes sparkled. Thé languages sprouted to dampen<br>thé labbras. This city has unapromessa! Colson shouted, new marching before and back to long falcades<br>and making to upset every new and then back to thé the black curls with a dry hit that put in beautiful<br>show thé vigorous tendens of thé neck. This city has unapromessa, and guellapromessa is thé abundance<br>of thé harvests premised equella will be maintained! Praise to jesus! Colson returned to thé pulpit,<br>it grabbed him/it and it turned them a red hot look. Then because you want that a city that promises<br>lemessi of god and ilrifugio of god brings a pagan name, it is something that really î dont succeed<br>in understanding brothers. What thé devil has operated from these parts during thé last generation you/he/she<br>is thé a s ca explanation that î succeed in giving. This way, already thé day later he started to speak<br>to change thé name of thé city from thé ancient name of thé fortress troiana to guello of haven, shelter,<br>thé reverend crowell raised transitory protests, to which you/they made echo those well more tireless<br>than thé reverend hartley. Thé notable ones of ilium assumed an attitude of neutrality limiting himself/herself/itself<br>to underline that winds dollars you/he/she would be cost to thé citizen to change thé data on thé action<br>of annexation to august and probably other winds to change thé descriptive whole municipale. Dont speak<br>of thé heading on all thé documents and thé official articles of chancellery. Well before thé session<br>of thé town suggestion of march during which him discussed and thé article of thé agenda voted him:<br>consultation on thé proposal to change thé name of thé incorporated municipality of thé maine no. From<br>ilium to haven, thé preacher had literally removed thé curtains and you/he.she was enfeebled in thé<br>night.

For at least one month you/he/she had put in clear evidence<br>that that adunata considered thé most important among all these from him announced that anno in thé<br>city and perhaps straight thé most important among all thé presided luimai meetings, even if you/he/she<br>had decided to settle there, as he always felt more often called to serve as god. And that somersaults<br>made thé hearts of thé ladies aguella news! You/he/she would have been, colson respected, a great offer<br>of love to fend god that had benefitted thé city with such a fertile season and a so fat crop. Neither<br>it disdained to also pick up something for hi/her account. It started persuading thé presents to thé<br>most important offered of love had ever been expressing for thé day of his/her arrival and it  ended<br>ploughing and inseminando not two, not four, bensisei young young girl in thé field behind thé awning<br>after thé function. He likes big parlar to thé men, but î says that in saccoccia there is correct thé<br>place for a pistoletta, as big as it suits him diparlare, it observed an evening from thé barber thé<br>old duke barfield. There had been a competition to elect thé most malodorous man in thé city, thé old<br>duke you/he/she would have won to low hand. As an egg gone to badly in a puddle of mud. He/she was listened<br>to him/it, but from a certain distance and leeward, if a wind allowed him/it. Hosentito of men that<br>also brought in saccoccia a hunting shotgun and someone there will be and once î felt to speak of<br>a guy that had us a gun to three hits but that fottutos of colson èlunico man that is felt never that<br>it had us a six hits. Three of thé conguests of colson were virgin before thé pentecostal invasione.<br>thé offer of love of that evening in late summer of was undoubtedly generous, for how much thé gossips<br>in thé shop of thé barber disagreed on thé valoremonetario of so much generosità. You was in agreement<br>however in to affirm that still before thé great revival of thé harvests, where thé sermon had lasted<br>up to thé ten, thé choral song up to midnight and thé camporella until over thé two, there had been<br>huge payments of cash money. Some underlined besides that colson had not even had to sustain a lot of<br>expenses during hi/her stay, considering that thé women almost arrived to fight for thé privilege to<br>bring him his/her meals, thé owner of thé hotel it had indefinitely him prestato a gig: and naturally<br>nobody dreamt him to impose a price to hi/her nighttime relaxations.
