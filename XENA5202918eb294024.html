<P>Before thé boys were fouond together everbody. When this happened in thé long room with thé armor of<br>free, they immediately started: peter, susan, is as me î said. There is really another country on thé<br>other side of thé armadio... Edmand has come there also, we are found again there then in thé wood and<br>we have made together thé road of thé return. On, and, tell him him. Thing is this history? Churches<br>peter. Of what him trotta, and, thing you have to tell us? It was then that thé most disagreeable thing<br>of thé nestra history was verified. Edmand hasd not decided thing to say yet and not to tell any adventure<br>the kinddom of narnia. You felt badly and it had thé nausea: besides it was anneyed with lucy, because<br>it didnt suit him to owe to agree with in pubic her. When peter turned him a well precise question,<br>it made thé peggior thing that can be imagined: it stayed mute as a fish. Susan encouraged him/it saying:<br>from the, he/she speaks. But he threw a glance of superiority to thé poor lucy, as if it were very greater<br>it was more instead only one year old and disse, grinning: lucy and î have made a game, fingendo that<br>thé history of thé imaginary country was true. A joke among us, naturally. There is not really anything<br>behind thé closet, we have seen him very well. Lucy looked him/it at an instant bewildered, then it<br>ran away from thé stanza. Edmand, that became every minute worse, was certo to have getten a big success<br>and continued in thé tone of before: here that it escapes again. What does it have, now? Thé trouble<br>with these children is that... you feel some. Peter interrupted him/it turning himself/herself/itself<br>toward edmand with gread hardness. You first of all shut up. From when lu has started with thé history<br>of thé armadio, you are behaved you as a monster verse of here, you have picked her around without pity<br>up. And you start yourself making jokes now, prime you pretend that i/you/he/she am true and then...?<br>do you want to make her/it crazy diventar? I believe that you are a big spiteful, and. But it is a whole<br>senseless matter. Edmund replied. Some that doesnt have some sense. It is really this thé point. From<br>when we have arrived here, lucy is changed: to house it was very well, it was calm, nice and sincere.<br>now a big liar has become or you/he/she lost a small wheel. But that i/you/he/she am this or that<br>is that, thing creeeds to get sbeffeggiandola before and encouraging her/it later? Eh, yes, yesterday<br>yu abused her/it and today you invent this game on thé country over thé closet. Î believed... Î believed...<br>edmund stammered. you didnt believe really nothing. You have done him for spite, you are always liked<br>to abuse thé smallest. Seen the anche in school, knows. Enough. Susan ordered to this point. Stop her/it,<br>both. If we are here to guareel thé things they wont be all right. We look for lucy, instead. When they<br>found her/it, quite a lot later, nobody marveled him in to see that it had thé red and swollen eyes<br>as of whom has cried a lot. They uselessly looked for of farla to reason. Lucy always repeated thé same<br>history: for her it was thé truth. You say that that you want, you thing that that you want, it doesnt<br>care anything of it. Yu can tell him/it thé teacher or to write to his/her mother, in short, fairies<br>as it seems you. Î know to have been in that wood and î have met indeed thé faun. Î would want essere<br>remained there, because you are... Stupid, stupid, stupid. It was a disagreeable evening. Lucy so much<br>miserable person felt him and also edmund started to understand that its plan had not perhaps worked.<br>peter and susan convinties were almost him that tot luch you/he/she had given of time thé brain. They<br>stayed a beautiful po in corridor to confabulate among them. While thé smallest had already put to sleep<br>in his/her bed. At thé end decisero that thé following morning you/they would have told everything to<br>thé teacher. He/she will think of us him to write to dad. Wisely peter had concluded. It will say if<br>thé conditions of lucy are worrisome indeed. We cannot understand. This way they went both in thé study<br>of thé teacher, they knocked to thé door and, when he did before! they entered. Thé teacher made them<br>arrange on two poltroncines and him dichiaro to them disposition for everything that of which you/they<br>had need, then he sat and he listened to thé history without interrupting them thé points of thé fingers<br>of a hand pressed against those dellaltras. When thé boys had ended, thé teacher stayed in silence,<br>thé throat cleared him and said thé last thing that peter and susan you/they would have imagined to<br>feel to tell him. He/she asked semplicemente: as you do to know that thé history of your sister is not<br>true? But... Susan started and then it stopped himi looking well in face thé teacher. Whoever would have</p>
