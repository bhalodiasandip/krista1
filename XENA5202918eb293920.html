<P>Grace of god; then when brother pierce has come in thé city, and now î has seen him stroll about around<br>here. Robin been not said thé trouble to say that connie possessed a picture of tom painted in thé it<br>made a depth breath. You/he/she could not postpone more and diresse thé look toward thé extended figure<br>on thé table. Also in thé death she was resplendent. His/her beauty, robin thought, you/he/she could<br>challenge thé grave. Its face was firm in an alive espressione. It had thé open eyes, with thé ends<br>eyebrows ravvicinate in a perplexed expression. Thé hands were joined on thé womb. We have thrown away<br>thé drawstrings, fred harris said. It was tied up to thé table. Robin prayed in his/her presonal way,<br>without words, thé goddess that inspired him subjection and thé god that you/he/she loved. He/she left<br>that their image flowed him in thé mind; thé tall one, pale goddess and his/her dark consort, that you/they<br>wondered as always in thé country dellestate. It needed their comfort, at that time. Through thé windows<br>of thé basement thé sound of molti clascon and thé sharp noise of people it entered full of anger. Maledetti,<br>did thé sheriff exclaim, they dont want to leave us alone eh? Thé horns played with a hot tempered<br>rythm, with known lunghe and sour. It is dead also one of theirs, today. Robin, that man was trying<br>to set on fire your fattoria! You/he/she has made an ugly death. There people were literally snarling<br>out, with voices sorde and deep, as thé rain that already falls on a place allagate. It will be better<br>that i/you/he/she go above to make him to new give an ugly quarter of, thé sheriff said. It went out<br>in hurry crossing thé basement. Robin turned around thé extermity of thé table. He/she thought of chiuderle<br>thé eyes. He is not able, friend, feeed harris said. It is troppo to change her expression late. He/she<br>didnt want that it stayed so, it was not a proper expression for a corpse. Despite pits so cold, his/her<br>body manteneva thé flexibility of thé alive muscles. In certain way this was more impressive anche of<br>thé fixed look of any dead body. Obviously it was not in peace. There is not really any way? Î could<br>make them seem closed, but î should bring her/it in my laboratorio. Its eyes had thé tone of thé light<br>of thé moon that weakens toward morning. Constance had said: each of us has a hidden name our nomereale.<br>when thé chiamate in thé circle, call her/it moon. Moon, moon? You/they had asked. No, with herm.<br>moon is his/her true name. La leannan calls her/it this way. Goodbye, moom, Good trip. If it imagined<br>her/it on thé old road in thé wood, with thé suitcase in hand, that got further camminando in hurry.<br>it sent forth long sight of pain. It was him granted a vision of moom: a dark, low and fat creaturina<br>as a ball, that stinked of smoke and of rancid grasso flood of pride and rice. That was thé moom gievane.<br>thé ancient soul now seemed to hover above of him, with thé serious face of thé wisdom of long periods.<br>î feel her. It is here, in this room. You come, î coffin has now, arrived. Robin wanted to be another<br>alone minute with her, but there was a lot of people that waited and out î noise was always stronger<br>diventando. They felt some thuds, of thé stones that colpivano thé house. Thé sheriff williams shouted<br>but without getting granché. Than above they kept on singing. Amazing grace, then thé song of thé pentacolo.<br>pentacolo you are resplendent, hands us light and splendore, oh, you are resplendent, pentacolo is<br>resplendent: ivy drove thé song with his/her powerful voice. It goes on, robin, and of to someone<br>of my men to go down to help me. Î want to do him/it. Its body was inactive and cold. To put on her his/her own<br>fingers in that way, when in his/her imagination it was so calda and flood of life, were very difficult<br>indeed. But you/he/she had to do him/it; he as responsible of this body. THey tied her to thé stretcher<br>and they brought her/it through Î seminterrato. Other hands brought her/it above for thé staircases.<br>when robin arrive in top thé stretcher was turning thé angle to enter thé stay. Thé house was full of<br>yellow lights that trembled. Thé bees had arrived with a lot of boxes of their candles done to hand.<br>witches of maywell, a box of pine polished to hand of admirable invoice. That thé meat quickly returns<br>to his/her mother, connie had said. Thé box was a concession to thé government laws on thé burial. Ruby<br>of thé circle of thé rocks drew near to thé head of thé coffin and said a long look to amanda. We will<br>return back in procession, it said. Thé rocks will bring her/it up to thé montagna. Then thé coffin</p>
