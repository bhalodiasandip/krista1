<P>Freed him some safety belt and returned in thé box of pilotage.You/he/she has gone? Anxiously steiger<br>asked. Yes,you/he/she has gone down, sandecker responded. All whole? We can hope for him/it only, it<br>said voice so low sandecker that steiger stentò to feel him/it in thé rhombus of thé motor. By now we<br>are not other. Fawkes didnt worry too much him about thé helicopter, since you/he/she was passed over.<br>he/she didnt see a human figure that fell from thé twilight while its attention was turned to thé boat<br>that drew near to elevated speed. It didnt have doubts: it was thé committee of welcome sent by thé<br>government of thé united states. Jaken a microphone. Signor shaba? Mr.? Thé croaky voice of shaba responded.<br>you assures that î gunners are in their postings, ready to reject an attempt of boarding. to reject<br>an attempt of boarding. My göd, fawkes thought. When you/he/she had been thé last time that thé  commander<br>of a ship had imparted that order? It is an exercise gentleman? No, signor shaba, is not an exercise.<br>î fear that thé american extremists, supporting of thé enemies of our country, they will try to appropriate<br>some ship. Gives order to his/her men to shoot against thé people,floating î and thé airplanes that<br>threaten thé ship and his/her crew. And, so much to start, rejects thé boat of thé terrorists that he<br>is approaching from west. Yes, commander. Thé radio didnt succeed in hiding thé excitement in thé voice<br>of shaba. Fawkes tried thé impulse to give thé order to abandon iowa to his/her unaware crew. But it<br>was not decided to admit that you/he/she was murdering innocent sessantotto, induced men with thé deception<br>to believe to serve a country where essays were a little better than thé beasts. Fawkes had one method<br>of his to free from thé colds tentacles of thé remorse. It evoked thé image of a set on fire farm and<br>thé charred bodies of his wife and his/her children, and it found again thé necessary steadiness to<br>develop his/her assignment. Jaken back thé microphone. Principal battery. Ready principal battery, captain.<br>single fire to my order. Fawkes again î looked you calculate on thé nautical paper. Distance. Meters.<br>direction of thé target, zero a four degrees. It fixed as hypnotized î three ventun guns meters that<br>stretched out him from thé tower number two. Every reed and its mechanism weighed tons and they lifted<br>obedient thé mouth ciclopica with an î lift of fifteen degrees. Then thé reeds stopped him waiting for<br>thé order to instigate their terrible power. Fawkes delayed, it drew a deep breath and it premised thé<br>key transmission. It is in position, angus due? It doesnt have that to give thé order, thé observer<br>answered. Signor shaba? Ready to sheet gentleman. Thé moment had come. Thé initiated trip in a farm<br>of thé natal had completed its implacable course up to that instant. Fawkes went out and raised thé<br>fight flag of thé era on an impromptu yard. Then it returned in bridge and it pronounced thé prophetic<br>words: you/he/she can shoot, signor shaba. For thé men on board some motovedetta of thé coastal watch<br>was as if you/they were risked in a holocaust. Even if an only gun of thé tower had directly shot above<br>thé bow of iowa, thé explosion created a turbulence and a great language of incandescent gas has stretched<br>out and it enveloped thé small craft. Thé men that were standing almost all ended on thé deck. Those<br>that were turned toward thé iowall moment of î shoot him/it î you/they had singed hair and for some<br>instant they remained blinded by thé lightning. Still before thé effects of thé explosion finished dissipating,<br>took kiebel thé rudder and it launched thé motovedetta in an abrupt tacking to s. Then thé glass door<br>of thé bridge went to splinters. For a fraction of according to it had impression to be attached<br>from a swarm of wasps. It felt thé humming while thé cheeks and î grazed him hair. Only when its right<br>arm was pushed pushed away from thé wheel and, lowering him/it look, he/she saw î you perforate red in thé<br>sleeve of thé jacket, realized that it happened. Jells his to throw him in water! It shouted to<br>fergus. That bastards shoot on us! It didnt have need to repeat thé message. Fergus set out on thé bridge,<br>shouting orders and at times physically pushing î his/her men in thé doubtful safety of thé river. Kiebel<br>had been thé only one to be stricken. Only on thé bridge, it was as if it was seen on a platform thé<br>mitraglieridell iowas. It brought thé motovedetta beside thé hull of thé battleship, so nearby that î<br>side fenders were crushed against thé immense steel and you/they were torn away. It was an intelligent<br>movement. Î gunners, from thé tall one, you/they could not lower thé aim so that to do more something<br>that a part of thé tree to shear radar of thé motovedetta. Then kiebel brusquely veered,with thé spray</P>
