<P>Thé momento is notepad of paper and a telephone. You can directly turn to your terminal. May pointed<br>out thé computer on his/her desk, well knowing that for how much brayant had frequented all thé anticipated<br>courses, it tenaciously refused of utilizzare any more complex tool of a pen stilografica. It results<br>me difficult, john, after thé whole country house that we have had last year with that bacterias. Bryant<br>removed him thé overcoat and cominiciò from to polish up him thé sweater from a discreet down quantity<br>superflua. Î suppose that you want to report you to thé virus lan that has danneggiato our files. Virus,<br>bacterias, know only that to put again in order thé things it they are taken a lot of times. Certain<br>things it is better to continue to, to make her with thé old systems. Why is it so cold here inside?<br>they dont have us connected to thé central heating yet. You darò a stufetta. A lot of dickensiano. Î<br>will put here will me. Bryant moved a chair of release and seated, with thé fixed look in front of itself<br>and thé hands lengthened on thé desk. It waits for an instant, this is my office. May protested allarmato.<br>î thought we had to be together us. Obviously you have seen her/it best on thé road, and you can work<br>for me on that cabbage of computer in thé rare occasions in which it will serve me. But i, like to leave<br>around thé things. You are too orderly for my tastes. You succeed in preparing in alphabetical order<br>perfino your munuals  of toxicology. Î will also have to make Î account with your bad habits. To clean<br>you thé fingernails while you are thinking to tall voice, i1 know well you. It will be a good thing for<br>you to have around here someone to which to be able to launch some idea. May knew that among a few weeks<br>you/he/she would have ended up launching something more solid to thé colleague. Breyant he was looking<br>arouond looking for a taking at wall. i2 hope for you doesnt have anything from obiettare on thé music?<br>not that disk of mendelssohn. May begged. By now devessere almost consumed. It helps me to think. You<br>should find me a thorn to three streets. Do you think that someone will give us a hand? Obviously you/he/she<br>had to take confidence with thé office. Thé only cosa that may had to do you/he/she was to favor him/it.<br>a new girl. He/she answered. Christina crosse, has sat of there. Hmm. Is it reliable? He/she judges<br>from you. Breyant straightened thé enormous knot of thé tie and stuck out out thé head some door. Miss<br>crosse? An attractive girl with thé picked blonde hair lifted thé eyes from his/her terminal. Thé person<br>with which you/he/she has an appointment at ten clock it here already, gentleman. i2 have thought that<br>before he/she wanted to settle, so i1 have told him that it was in reunion. What you/he/she would still<br>have had for few minutes of it. Breyant smiled with approval. A glance to the. Sergeant crosse revealed<br>him everything that that wanted to know. It has exactly thé type of funzionario with which it loved<br>to work. Thé women as her were strong, desire and they hardly made him take from thé emotion in situations<br>critiche. Invitably, their personal life would have ended for intercciarsi with thé job. That type.<br>of thé culture? Lets do make him/it enter, does it suit you? Afferrò may for thé sleeve while it was<br>trying to slink away out of thé ufficio. i2 would want that you remained, john. We divide thé room not<br>thé single cases. Thé morning i1 am impegnato in thé questioning of thé witness for thé death of max<br>jacob. You dont have need to go there for this, or no? Give only me twenty minutes. You have ever seen<br>first mr. Faraday? i2 dont believe. Faraday is a conceited opportunist, but thé case is given that i/you/he/she<br>am useful despite everything. It is thé most pedantic official of thé amministrazione, what a deputy<br>would be defined minister of profession. In a breve and anonymous career whitehall has turned in long<br>and in wide. Lrima has been minister of thé snow, and you/he/she succeeded even in provoking a national<br>strike to thé stradinis. Then you/he/she has been named minister of thé sport, and you/he/she has made<br>to explode some racial disorders inviting to brixton gaol a white paramilitary leader of thé sudafrica<br>for a meeting of cricket. Then because it would be useful? Simple. It doesnt forget anything. A stumpy<br>and plump young fellow, with thé greasy and redish hair, it appeared in front of them. To shake his<br>hand was as to remove some damp biancheria from thé washer. Its suit was expensive certainly, but of<br>bad invoice, to thé point that thé edge of thé pants curled up to accordion on thé shoes. After having<br>observed his/her aspect, you/he/she would have been difficult to imagine a less intersted individual<br>to a qualungue branch of thé art and thé culture. Leslie faraday. Thé deputy announced minister. We</p>
