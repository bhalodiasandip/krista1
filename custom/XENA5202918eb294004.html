<P>Making. Either thé two men visited deck in thé meantime, or thé labeling is wrong. Thé enterprise things<br>one of thé most successful peacemakers of thé interstellar league of nation a man by thé name of riva<br>after solari v. Asked thé warlike parties of that planet ah ben thé federation of a mediation. Riva<br>is deaf mute, and therefore he it is accompanied by three helpers, who should convert his its thoughts<br>and feelings in words. As thé enterprise reaches thé goal of thé trip, she it swings into an orbit.<br>riva and his its interpreters leamen itself together with riker and worf on thé planet. Repräsen aunts<br>of thé two verfeindeten camps approach; one of them opens thé fire and shoots thé three assistants.<br>riker and worf pack riva, turns towards quickly to thé enterprise quiz ask which word riva added thé<br>klingonischen? How is thé sign of blue in thé first gesture language, that learns data? Move. Thé mediator<br>is supremely dismayed. Thé death of his its friends fills him it with deep mourning; he it feels little<br>al for itself without her it them and helpless. Licard asks data to learn thé gesture language of thé<br>peacemaker. A kommwnika tionsbasis is admittedly created with it, but riva nevertheless rejects it,<br>on this planets, to come back. He it thiks that data is only in thé situation, that not however to<br>pass on words, thé feelings. Froi please picard about permission, to be able to visit thé planet, in<br>order to contribute to a solution of thé problem there. Meanwhile, thé situation becomes worse on solari<br>v more and more. Before troi sets off, she it speaks with riva once again and learns about him it: thé<br>secret of thé success is to change disadvantages at an advantage. Deanna asks thé mediator why he it<br>now believes himself no more capable for it. The it proves as so stubborn, that riva is finally willing<br>to undertake another attempt. He it transfers himself on thé planet in order to teach thé warlike parties<br>his its ges tensprache. Riava hopes that they not only learn through talking to him it but also among<br>each other. Inconsistencies with thé action after data rivas gesture language learned, picard and thé<br>mediator meet in thé observation room. Thé captain riva tries during her its their conversation to convince<br>to come back on thé planet, about there peaces to sheeep fen. Riva rejects and leaves thé area. Where<br>does he it go? Thé observation chamber is on deck, directly behind thé main bridge. Thé mediator would<br>have to use a turbo elevator in order to reach his its quarters. Al lerdings: for thé application of<br>thé elevators, verbal kom mandos are necessary, and riva is mute. Wide expeditions dont come along through<br>thé enterprise for him it in question. Logic and prerequisites as thé enterprise solari v reaches, worf<br>reports laseraktivi tät. Licard asks thé inhabitants of thé planet, unhesitating thé fire, to put in,<br>alternatively would leave thé enterprise again thé solar system. He it emphasizes that he it wants to<br>bring his its ship to case in danger on kei nen. Apparently, pi bluffs card. In thé impossible captain<br>okona, he it amused spoken with his its bridge officers over spaceships, that attacked only with lasers.<br>at that opportunity, he it pointed out that laser radiations can penetrate not even them her it navigation<br>sign, from thé diflectors completely to schwei towards. Appliances and equipment in this episode, riker<br>adjusts his its phaser in a quite strange way. Shortly before thé transfer of solari v, he it puts in<br>thé emission step of his its emitter while thé run points at his its stomach. That seems to be quite<br>risky, or? As riva beamt itself with his its assistants on thé planets, one of thé native spins and<br>shoots. Ricker tears thé mediator to thé side, and thé helpers are met by thé ray lightning by it. You<br>they solidify and dissolve like in slow motion, so to speak layer about layer. This scene is very impressive,<br>but so weapon can probably hardly work laser radiations a laser burns. Or do thé inhabitants of solari<br>a have special copies at their disposal? Did worries around his its ship therefore make picard for itself?<br>problems with continuity and production shortly before riva comes to thé bridge, riker wesley gives<br>thé instruction to program a course after solari v. At this time, thé first officer sits in thé command<br>chair. Dr. Lulaski sat down beside him it and looks at him it. A scene follows, that shows us, as thé<br>spaceship enterpri se away races. We see some seconds later as thé door of thé turbo elevator opens:<br>riva and his its assistants step on thé control area. Everything appears completely normally. However<br>pu laski is missing. Where is she it missing? The it could, she it increases re seconds long sequence,<br>that showed us thé ship in thé universes, had used to sprinting to a turbo elevator and leaving thé bridge.</p>
