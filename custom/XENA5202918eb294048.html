<P>Himself/herself/itself, they contained thé holder. Each of you must now think about thé person that<br>has portrayed before, and with which has had a test of power or a bond of blood. You send away from<br>thé mind thé whole rest, except thé person that you must reach and to fold up to our will. Because we<br>will now win thé game of thé power on this table... Or will fail! Thé eyes of simon were fixed on thé<br>figure of thé holder. He/she didnt know if you/he/she would have been able to dissuade them wanting.<br>he/she thought about having been called to participate in that ecentric procedure because him, only,<br>among all those people who belonged to thé strengths of estcarp, you/he/she had seen thé commander of<br>gorm. Thé minuscule face, shaded by thé metalic cap, it magnified, it assumed natural proportions.<br>simon faced him/it through thé space as you/he/she had faced him through that room, in thé heart of<br>sippar. Thé eyes were closed again; thé man was busy in his/her mysterious activity. Simon kept on studiying<br>him/it, and then he/she knew that thé whole antagonism for î holder, thé whole violent hate in him from<br>how much you/he/she had discovered in thé city, from their way to treat imprisoned î, they assembled<br>him in his/her mind: it was as if it composed small pieces to draw a formidable weapon of it. Simon<br>was not in thé curtain shaken by thé winds of thé sea anymore, where sand blew on painted hawk. It<br>was instead in front of thé holder in thé heart of sippar, and with his/her wish it imposed him to open<br>thé closed eyes, to look at him/it to get ready to a mental fight. Thé eyes opened, and simon fixed<br>thé dark pupils, he/she saw thé eyelids rise more, as to recognize thé threat that used him as point<br>of concentration as thé couldron in which every terror and every danger could be brought to thé ebullition.<br>thé eyes of thé one fixed thé eyes of thé other. Thé impressions of thé flat face, of thé metallic cap,<br>of everything, except that eyes, it faded away, few to little. How simon had felt thé flow of thé power<br>pass from his/her hand to that of thé witch, to kars, now he/she knew that thé boiling energy in him<br>was continually fed by a greater heat of that that you/they could produce its emotions, that he was<br>a weapon to launch a fatal dart. To thé beginning, thé kolder had opposed him with safety; it now tried<br>to free from that blond among eye and eye, between mind and mind, recognizing to be taken in trap too<br>late. But thé trap had gone off, and for how much it fought, thé man could not melt from what you/he/she<br>had accepted in thé arrogant trust toward his/her from of magic. Simon felt thé whole tension brusquely<br>burst out from him to pass from him to thé other. Thé eyes were submerged by thé panic, thé panic left<br>thé place to an abject terror that kept on burning up to when it didnt find anything to feed. Simon<br>included to have of alone forehead an empty hull, that would have obeyed to his/her wish as î empty<br>hulls of gorm they obeyed to thé wish of their masters. Î imparted his/her orders. Thé power of thé<br>keeper fed his; she observed and it attended, ready to help him/it, but without advancing suggestions.<br>simon was certain of thé obedience of his/her enemy as it was sure of thé life that burned inside of<br>him. What checked gorm you/he/she would be crumbled, thé barrier would be fallen, until that tool you/he/she<br>had continued to operate without obstacles from his similar. Estcarp now had an ally robot inside thé<br>fortitude. Simon lifted thé head, it opened thé eyes, and he/she saw thé painted table on which its<br>fingers still tightened those some keeper around thé feet of thé statuette. But thé manikin was not<br>more perfect. Within thé hollow of thé metallic cap, thé head was shapeless mass of was purrs. Thé<br>keeper loosened thé hold, you/he/she withdrew thé hand and you/he/she abandoned him inactive. Simon<br>turned thé head, he/she saw on thé left a tense face and whitened, with thé hooped eyes, while thé woman<br>that had assembled thé power on aldis he abandoned on his/her seat. And also thé figuretta of thé dame<br>had thé devastated head. Thé image that had been baptized with thé name of fulk of verlaine was upset,<br>and briant was raggomitolato on himself, with thé face hidden among thé hands, î colorless hair glued<br>on thé skull by thé sweat. You/he/she is done. It was thé keeper to break thé silance. What thé power<br>can do, you/he/she has done. In this day we have powerfully operated, how come you/he/she has made thé<br>blood of estcarp. Is now up to thé fire and thé sword, to thé wind thé wave, serve us if they will<br>want , and if thé men will use them! It was a thread of exhausted voice. He/she answered her someone<br>that approched to thé table to stay in front of her, accompained by thé light tinkling of thé metal</p>
