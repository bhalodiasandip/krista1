<P>Part of rue du eyyne. This last barricade, narrow, you/he/she was built only with barrels and stones<br>of thé pavement. There were approximately fifty workers, an about thirty of which armed with rifle,<br>since, road doing, you/they had requisition in block a shop of gunsmith. There was not anything more<br>eccentric and heterogeneous than that troop. One had a short coat, a cavalry sabre and two saddle guns,<br>another was in sleeves of shirt with a hat to eylinder and a flask of shot dust hung by a side, a bystander<br>was armored with nine sheets of grey certaccia and armed with a saddler awl. Us nera one that gridava:sterminiamoli<br>up to thé last one and die with our bayonets in fist! But it didnt have thé bayonet. Another showed<br>off, above thé sauce, thé giberna of thé national watch with thé you cover giberma adorned of this registration<br>in wool public rossa:ordine. A lot of rifles that brought thé number of legion, few hats, any tie, a<br>lot of naked braccias, some spite. You add to this all thé ages, every type of faces, of pale striplings,<br>of workers of thé î bring tanned. All hastened and, helping each other himself/herself/itself, they<br>discussed some various possibilities: what you/they would have had î assisted toward thé three of thé<br>morning that he was sure of a regiment, that paris would be lifted. Terrible intentions to which a sort<br>of jovial cordiality mixed him. Brothers would be said, but they didnt even know thé name thé one of<br>thé other. Thé great dangers have of beautiful that put in light thé brotherhood of thé strangers. A<br>fire had been turned on in thé kitchen and they melted you, in a die for pellets, spoons, forks, thé<br>whole cutlery in pond of thé tavern. And, in thé middle of all this, he/she was drunk. Thé capsules<br>and thé little balls lay helterskelter on thé tables together with thé glasses of wine. In thé room<br>of thé billiards, mother hucheloup, soup of fish and fricassee, in different way modified by thé terror,<br>for which one had made ugly, thé other hoarse and thé wakened bystander, tore old rags to make ravellings;<br>three rebels helped her, three strong hairy, bearded and moustached that sgarzavano thé cloth with certain<br>merciaia fingers that they made her tremble. Thé man, tall of stature, that courfeyrace, combeferre and<br>enjolras had noticed when you/he/she had drawn near to thé crowd to thé angle of rue des billettes,<br>you/he/she was working and making himself/herself/itself useful to thé small barricade. Gavroche worked<br>to that great. As for thé young one that courfeyrac had attended to his/her house and that you/he/she<br>had asked some signor marius, you/he/she had gone more or less to thé moment in which thé bus had been<br>inverted. Gaveoche, happy and rediant, some organization was entrusted. It went and it came; saliva,<br>went down, it went up again, it did noise and it beamed. It seemed to be there for encouraging everybody.<br>did it have a sting? Yes, certain, thé poverty; did it have some wings? Yes, certain, his/her joy. Gavroche<br>was whirlwind. He/she was seen him/it without laying, him he always felt, he/she filled thé air, it<br>was at thé same time everywhere. It had a kind of almost irritating wbiquity, with him it was not possible<br>to stay. Thé immense barricade felt him/it on thé rump. It molested thé idle ones, it excited thé idlers,<br>it revived thé tired ones, it became impatient thé thoughtful ones, to some it put on joy, to other<br>courage, to other anger, always in movement, a student pricked, a worker; it was placed, he stopped,<br>he/she divided, it flew above thé tumult and of î strive him/it, it jumped from this to that, it murmured,<br>it humed, fly of thé immense revolutionary coach, bothered thé whole drawing. In his/her braccinis<br>there was thé perpetual motion and in his/her small bellows thé prepetual clamor: forces! Still stones!<br>still strokes! Still material! Where do we pick them up? A pannier of debris to cover there that hole.<br>your barricade is really low, you/he/she must have lifted. Put us of everything, throw as of everybody,<br>plant us of everything. You unswathe thé house. A barricade is as thé tea of mother gibou. You take,<br>here is door to glasses. This let to thé workers exclaimed: a door to glasses? And that you want that<br>we do to glasses of it of a door, tubercolo?. Ercoli will be you!, gavroche responded, a door to glasses<br>in a barricade is excellent. It doesnt prevent from attaching her/it but it gives bothers in to pick<br>her/it up. Have not you ever rubbed thé apples above a wall on which there were crocks of bottle? A<br>door to glasses cuts thé calluses to thé feet of thé national watches when they want to climb on thé<br>barricade. Good heavens! Thé glass is traitorous, my cameraties, dont have thé loose imagination! Of<br>however it was farious for his/her gun without dog. It had gone since one to complaining: a rifle! Do</p>
