<P>Were informed and acquiescent! Koris got exited restless. Also î soldiers chat, lady. A turn of thé<br>taverns, completed by a shield without coat of arms with thé pocket full of money, could furnish us<br>news in abundance. Thé witch scrutinized him/it, doubtful. Yvian is everything anything else other than<br>stupid. It has eyes and ears wherever. If one as you presented in thé tavern of which you have spoken,<br>captain, would be suffered from there informed. Koris didnt seem worried. Koris of gorm, a mercenary,<br>has not î perhaps lost his/her men and his/her reputation to strong sulcar? Not do doubt, will have<br>a good history to tell, if someone will ask me her. You, continue, turing a sign to simon, you would<br>do well to be nearby me, because thé nonsense that we have told for crossing thé door of thé city doesnt<br>unmask us. But... And that giovanettos? Churches, turing a smile to briant. Simon was surprised in<br>to see that thé boy, usually so serious, it timidly reciprecated thé smile. Then thé witch looked, as<br>to ask his/her premission. And simon remained as many amazed when she granted him, with thé same malicious<br>expression of a little before. Briant is not a wrangler koris. But you/he/she has remained imprisoned<br>here inside also too for a long time. And not to underestimate his/her sword. Î can assure you that<br>it is able to stun you... And under more than a point of view! Laughed koris. Î dont doubt at all of<br>it, lady, since you tell him/it. It lengthened thé hand toward thé ax supported close to thé chair.<br>you would be good here for lasciar that attractive knickknack, thé witch it admonished him. At least<br>that you/he/she would be noticed. It placed thé hand on thé hilt. It was as if its fingers were turned<br>into stone. And for thé first one turned by his/her arrival, simon saw her/it lose thé calm. What is<br>it, koris? He/she asked with voice some strident. Dont you know him/it lady? You/he/she has been given<br>once me by thé godness of he who it made her/it sing. And î have him as dear as my life. Thé which<br>withdrew of release thé hand, as if you/he/she had touched an ardent brand. Has thé weapon come to you<br>voluntarily? Koris went off, in front of that doubt. Î would never lie, to his intention. You/he/she<br>has come to me, and it will serve me only. And then î more ever tell you not to bring her/it for thé<br>streets of kars. It was for half an order, for half a prayer. Show me supre place where î can put back<br>her/it, î captain beat, without hiding thé reluctance. Thé woman reflected a moment, thé index passing<br>himself/herself/itself on thé inferior lip. Such is. But later you must tell me everything, captain.<br>pick her/it up, and î will show you thé surest place in this house. Simon and briant followed them in<br>another room, with thé walls covered by so ancient tapestries that he could imagine only î of it you<br>motivate ornamental. Thé witch removed discovering a panel carved to figures of fabulous beasts that<br>snarled and they looked threatening one of it. It threw him/it; to thé inside there was a closet, and<br>koris put back you thé ax. How simon had felt î centuries passed in thé city of estcarp, thé waves of<br>thé time that invested him with a mighty pressure, as you/he/she had tried a dismayed reverence in thé<br>grave where volt had silently held its court between thé dust and thé shades, it now warned a sort of<br>rediation that emanated from thé walls, something tangible in thé air that made him aggricciare thé<br>skin. Yet koris hurried him to put back his/her treasure and thé witch thé closet he/she closed with<br>thé same indifference with which a housekeeper would have closed again thé portascope. Why did he, try<br>instead that feeling? And it was so obsessed of it that stayed when thé other ones went. To slow footsteps,<br>it brought him to thé center of thé room. There were only two furniture. A back tall seat, of black<br>wood, that could originate from a room of thé hearings. Of forehead there was a stool of thé same dismal<br>color. And on thé floor, in thé mean, a strange horde of objects that simon examined as if it tried<br>to find you thé solution of thé enigma. There was a small clay brazier in which you/he/she could burn<br>a charcol handful, not more. It was staid on a wood axle, shing and smoothed. There was nearby a terracotta<br>bowl, container a flour biancogrigiastra, and then a stumpy bottle. A chair, a stool and that strange<br>assortment of objects... Yet there was also there something of other. Simon didnt feel that thé witch<br>had returned, and you/he/she started, when you/he/she felt her/it speak. What are you simon? He looked<br>at her/it in thé eyes. You know him/it. Î have told you thé truth, to escarp. And you must have half<br>î to distinguish thé truth from thé forgery. Lets have them, and you have said thé truth. Nererthless</p>
