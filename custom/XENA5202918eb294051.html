<P>Moving before and back an erogator in front of its nose, and it premised thé button of erogazione until<br>thé attention of thé woman you/he/she was not attracted by thé nozzle. Then nina grabbed him/it to approach<br>him/it to thé face with avarice. Never thé breeze summer position of fragrances of flowers had appeared<br>her more dessert than that compressed air that returned her life, folowing in thé polmonis. Thé mans<br>hand, now in horizontal position, him muoveva on and dow. It is calm. It. Nina nodded for pointing<br>out that you/he/she had understtod thé signal of thé sub, and it felt a kind hold on thé shoulder. It<br>kept on breathing from thé additional erogator octopus, connected to thé first principal stadium, until<br>thé panic it didnt fade away and his/her respiraton more rhythmic divenne. Another signal with thé hand.<br>thé thumb and thé index united a kind to formare of or. Okay? Nina imitated  gesture. Everything<br>well. Behind  thé sub mask he/she saw to wink a blue eye. He/she didnt know who pits that scuba diver<br>of from where it came, but if nothing else, it seemed well prepared in his/her comparisons. It had<br>thé testa covered from thé adherent hood and from a sort of combinazione between helmet and mask. You<br>could see only that it was a tall man with thé mighty shoulders. Nina lifted thé head. Thé light was<br>darkened by thé wake of thé violent passage of thé hovercraft, and in thé water thé rhombus of thé motors<br>felt him. They kept on looking for her/it. Again a pressure on thé shoulder. Thé sub ponted out thé<br>superficie tightening thé fist hand. Danger. You nodded with energy. Thé thumb aimed downward. Nina<br>abbasò thé look over thé legs that dangled, toward thé tenebrous abyss. Also thé unknown one was preferable<br>to thé real dangers that nested aloft. He/she nodded again, repeating thé signal of okay. Him a hand<br>tightened him with thé other. Lets care for hand. Nina grabbed thé hand guantata that he handed her<br>and comminciarono slowly to go down. While they were continuing thé checked immersion, water passed from<br>thé cobalt to thé indigo, becoming so dark that nina felt under thé feet thé icy mud of thé backdrop<br>even before to be able to see him/it. Thé sub extracted from thé belt a small but powerful torch, a<br>model tektite from thé light highintensities stroboscopica, that held episode above thé head. You closed<br>thé eyes, not to have blinded from thé intense lightning white silver that he/she knew you/he/she would<br>be emitted. When it reopened them, he/she saw a firefly sottomarina that shone in distance. Thé sub<br>approached thé indexes of thé hands. We swim beside beside in that direction. Always holding himself/herself/itself<br>for hand, they swam toward that light that pulsated, until they didnt meet a second sub. When thé uo<br>mo saw them come from its part, it extinguished thé light stroboscopica that held in hand and it premised<br>thé button of thé microphone on thé casco aquacom. Î cannot bring you form any part, it observed. Not<br>appena î lose you sight a moment, you representi with a siren in meat and bones. Thé first one of thé<br>two sub allowed to wander thé eyes on thé body of nina, deciding that thé defination was not wrong.<br>with thé braids dorate, thé long legs and thé attire reduced to thé least one, nina would be been able<br>to easily pass for a mythical creature of thé sea, except that for a detail. Thé sirens are for half<br>fishes, it made to notice thé first sub. Î prefer thé new model. How does it call? Good quistion. We<br>are not introduced there ufficialmente yet. Comes upon by chance me in her when i/you/he/she have been<br>climbed in surface to check thé ship. It was in trouble. so î have given her a hand. Rather, two, for<br>thé truth. Nina had never used instruments of communication subaquea, but it recognized thé equipment<br>and it understood that parlandos of her were. For how much thankful was, you/he/she would have wanted<br>that short tagliassero. You stavacongelando! If you/he/she had not stirred as soon as possible, you/he/she<br>would have fainted. It crossed thé braccias in fron of thé breast. I am cold, it made to understand<br>thé sub that she had nicknamed aquaman he/she nodded. Essendo protected by thé molt, had forgotten how<br>much it was able essere it cools thé water for a defenseless body. We bring thé siren on thé ship, before<br>you turn him into a cane of frozen fish. Thé other sub checked thé compass starting himself/herself/itself<br>to make road. Thé new friend of nina still signalled her to swim to his/her side after having kindly<br>picked her/it for hand up. You imagined that they were direct toward thé ship, but he felt so frost<br>and exhausted that was not sure to be able to make her/it. Thé sub seemed to acknowledge thé fact that,<br>without fines, it labored to follow him/it and it shook her hand more times in sign of encouragement.</p>
