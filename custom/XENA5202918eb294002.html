When mine had sacrificed thé them same to be, for me!<br>but in reality î had not compared her on thé events of thé preceding evening yet. Î felt to have anoora<br>need of time,before being able to relive thé h duto in his/her agonizing details. Therefore î was not<br>able proprio to blame kei if it rejoyoed as if some spirit pericoolosi and vengeful you/they had been<br>exorcized in four and guattrotto. It was not kei to irritate me in effects: î felt me in guilt for<br>thé anxiety to start a new life insieme with her. Î had sent away later my parents and thé day î was <br>sits to enjoy some company of an enchanting woman of it there. There is a thing that î must tell you,<br>î did. Ohoh. Î believe to be afraid, it beat her with a sorriso. Î have failed once already as î marry.<br>and î believe not to even have been a good father. Î am not sicure to deserve thé love of a person as<br>you. Then? Î would pfefer that î didnt make yourself illusions on me. Of thé type? Î dont know, but<br>at times î wonder me what i/you/he/she find us in me. Î fear that you have not seen how î am really.<br>all how much they delude him. Certain. And Î am not a granché, î assure him/it to you. And î imagine<br>yu wants to feel to tell you that it goes very well this way. Î believe of yes. Be, nossignore. If<br>dont be granché, then migliorati. Î dont have intention to approve you incondizionatamente as six.<br>wont get by so much facilmente, eh! It was right, naturally. Imiei parents me approved avevano as î<br>was, for how much î refused me, anche while you/they were fading away in thé nothing; but it was foolish<br>to wait him for thé same from a lover. Î would not want that î thought: kei started with a weak smile,<br>but he interrupted when our coffees arrived with thé sweets. Î enjoyed of his/her beauty mentre it waited<br>with thé eyes slightly lowered that thé owner went. You were saying? Î encouraged her/it to continue.<br>kei nodded and restarted: î would not want that î thought that î consider me special or other, but:<br>some that you a strong awareness of that that six. But î have shown only probabbly you my best side. Thé<br>fact that î hide you thé breast is an evident test of it. Î am not a suffered from thé selfinjury but<br>not sarei worthy of your even if î made her/it to put insieme up to thé last crumb of my strengths. But<br>my defects are particularly horrible. Î am grotesque horde. Also me. In thé worse moments, my deformity<br>nauseates me so that î would want only: it looked for thé words, to do ends her/it. That expression<br>touched me an open nerve. Aveve thé horrible presentiment that also kei was able commiciare to fade<br>away really under my eyes, without i/you could make nothing to stop her/it. Not to say these things,<br>î begged her/it. Î repeated: not dire these things. Kei nodded. Î didnt perceive some appannamentos<br>of his/her figure. While î was keeping on staring at her/it, î felt me happy more and more that her,<br>in effeots, it existed. While we were returning home afoot, î said: î would like to see your apartment.<br>of acoord, it immediately was worthwhile, but then he/she remained in silenzio for a certain time. You<br>have left thé house in disorder or something of thé genere? Î finally asked. No. no. If it puts you<br>to uneasiness, it doesnt need that i/you/he/she see him/it today. Thing makes you think that i/you/he/she<br>am to uneasiness? You have become so silent to thé sudden one. Î was mentally crossing again thé apartment.<br>your house can reveal so many things on you. Î want to know everything about you. Î wonder me if i/you/he/she<br>necessarily were a good. Dont you believe that at times thé peopele could be happier together if they<br>simply allowed to survive some false impression? Î will wait out then in thé corridor while you semini<br>false impression. No, it is all right. Î have a good time a world prunning me, but today î have more<br>desire than to leave to go me. Thé number were after all close to thé great apartment with three bedrooms<br>to thé corridor, and from out imagined avevo you/he/she had to be a small loading, with an only room<br>and a lower case letter gone cooking and lunch. Also for a similar lodging, thé lease in that gone of<br>tokyo was exorbitant. His perhaps gave her a hand sending her some extra money every month. What did<br>you/they think of thé fact that their daughter, to trentatré years, was not you/he/she still gotten<br>married? Did they know about his/her burn?
