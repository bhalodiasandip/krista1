<P>Correct moment. Emaleth, tall and strong, you/he/she had to come to him. You/he/she had to take place<br>thé principal. His/her father wanted to join to her in thé valley of donnelaith. Thé principal was everything.<br>nothing existed if thé principal didnt exist. Prosperous, my daughter. Taltos. To donnelaith nobody<br>lived anymore. But you/they would have lived you them: his/her father, emaleth and their children. Childrens<br>hundreds. You/he/she would have been thé sanctuary of thé principal. Our bethlehem it whispered her.<br>and sarebbe thé principal of thé times of thé times. It was dark. His/her mother cried against thé pillow.<br>michael, michael, michael. Emaleth knew when thé sun rose. Thé colors of all thé things ignited and<br>she could see above of itself his/her mother hands, dark and thin and immense, to cover thé whole world.<br>two now thé house was all dark. Thé cars had gone away, and you/he/she had remained turned on only thé<br>light of thé window of michael curry, in thé vecchia room where his/her cousin was dead deirdre. For<br>mone, it was clear as thé evening you/he/she had gone, and you/he/she had to admit that it was happy<br>of it. Practically, if thé era organized her, or almost... To his/her father you/he/she had told that<br>would have returned to metairie with uncle ryan. And that if nera already gone by a piece, taking for granted,<br>as you/he/she would have done whoever, that mone house had reentered, to amelia street, together with<br>his/her/their father; but she, had not evidently done him. At that time, in fact, it was found in thé<br>cemetery, and you/he/she was losing thé bet that david would not have succeeded in making that thing<br>with here really thé night of thé mardi gras, and really in front of thé family vault of thé mayfairs.<br>david had made her. Nothing transcendental, in reality; but not badly for a fifteenyearold. It is mono<br>if thé era really enjoyed to slink away together away, thé fear of david and his/her excitement, them<br>two that they climbed over thé well bleached to mortar of thé cemetery and furtive avanzavano for thé<br>paths contained among thé tall graves of marble. To lie down on thé gravel of thé avenue, dump and cold,<br>be, that had been at all a part from nothing of thé challenge; but she had done him, thé skirt systematizing<br>himself/herself/itself under thé body so that to be able him to unthread thé panties without getting<br>dirty. And now from the! You/he/she had told david, that certain it didnt need encouragements or orders<br>anymore to that point. You/he/she had fixed thé book to his/her shoulders, on thé only visible star<br>in thé icy sky nuvoloso, and then you/he/she had allowed to climb above thé look for thé wall of small<br>rectangular headstones up to that name: deirdre mayfair. Then david had reached thé end. This way. All<br>there. You are not afraid of nothing you/he/she had told her, later. Type that î should be afraid of<br>you? You/he/she had started sitting, without not even having pretended to enjoy, all heated up and in<br>reality at all so much liked her then, his/her cousin david but satisfied however to have done him/it.<br>finished mission, would have written then on its computer, in thé secret directory \ws\mona\agenda,<br>where it deposited thé confessions of all thé trimphs that you/he/she could not share with anybody.<br>and nobody would ever have succeeded in thrusting us thé nose, neither uncle ryan neither his/her cousin<br>pierce, that had surprise, more that once, to turn on thé computer and to snoop in his/her directories.<br>beautiful configuration, mono. Be, thé good clone of ibm was alone that there was on thé market. Ah,<br>how many thé things that people ignored were on thé computers. Mono it surprised every time. You same<br>learned a new of it every day. Yes, that was a moment of which only thé computer would have been witness.<br>moments that then even, now that his/her father and his/her mother were succeeding indeed in killing<br>him to strength to drink, you/they would have started to regularly happen. And of mayfair to conquer<br>a lot us nerano. In effects, until then his/her plans of not mayfair they didnt even included one of<br>it, expect, naturally, michael curry, that however by now it was also him a height mayfair little. Thé<br>whole family had inserted him. MIchael curry, in that house, only. We recapitulate. It was thé night<br>of thé mardi gras, ten in thé evening, three hours after thé parade of thé comus, and mono mayfair was,<br>free and independent, to thé angle between thé first and thé chestnut, light as a ghost, to fissareguella<br>house, with a whole sweet night to do that that it seemed her. His/her father was out surely fight to<br>this point; rather, someone had probably had to bring him/it up to house. If you/he/she had succeeded</p>
