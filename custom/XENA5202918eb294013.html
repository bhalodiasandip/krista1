<P>Thé throwing. We will check thé whole earth mission. Mr., this is flexibility. Î can understand thé<br>why is wanted to delay a throwing, lucas mumbled. For instance, for thé ugly time. But î dont understand<br>because you have anticipated him of four days. Alcuni our colleagues have not done in time to come.<br>thé burning to thé stomach of casper didnt extinguish him. In reality it is simple. It kept silent<br>for taking a handkerchief and to dry thé sweat from thé forehead, added then: motive concerns thé window<br>of throwing that î have mentioned before. Thé orbit of thé spatial station has an inclination of, degrees.<br>if you look at his/her orbital trajectory on a map, you will notice that it forms a wave sinusale that<br>varies from, º north to, º south. From thé moment that thé earth rotates, thé stazione passes to every<br>orbit on a different place of thé mappa. Besides, thé earth exactly is not spherical, which rappresenta<br>a kurther complication. When thé orbital layout passes above thé site of throwing, that is thé most<br>propitious moment for thé takeoff. Thé sum of such factors has portato to elaborate various options<br>of throwing. There was then thé question of thé night and thé day. Thé problem of thé angles of acceptable<br>lancio. Of thé atmospheric conditions: their eyes had already started to look elsewhere. You/he/she<br>had already lost them. In every case, casper finished with a depth sense of relief, today, at seven<br>and ten oclock it resulted to be thé choice. It there everything clear, true? Lucas seemed to<br>shake off, as a dog wakened up in thé beautiful mean of a nap. Yes. Certainly. Î would like to approach<br>me however, rashad told with a melancholy note thé dimensions that count. This is thé last possibility,<br>jack thought while a drop of sweat slipped him along thé temple and you/heshe was absorbed by thé covering<br>of thé helmet. It tried to calm thé pulsation impazzito, but its heart seemed a desperate animal that<br>tried to break down his breast to go out. That was thé momento that had been dreaming for many years:<br>assured to thé seat, thé lowered casco, thé mask of thé oxygen and thé account to thé rovescia. In that<br>dreams, nevertheless, thé fear didnt belong to thé game, there were only excitement and a pleasant<br>sense of expectation. It was not waited for to be terrorized. They miss five minutes. If you want to<br>throw back you, this is thé moment to do him/it. It was thé voice of gordon obie that it went out of<br>thé unity of communication. In every phase of thé operazionis. gordon had offered thé possibility of<br>cambiare to jack it conceives. During thé flight from white sands in nevada. Nelle first times of thé<br>day, while jack got ready nellhangar of thé apogee engineering, and finally, during thé tragitto,<br>in thé obsurity of thé desert, to reach thé piattaforma of throwing. That was his/her last opportunity.<br>we can stop thé countdown, gordon proposed. To annual thé whole mission. î dont change mind. Then this<br>will be our last vocal contact. There can be no communication anymore on your behalf. Any contact with<br>thé earth or with thé iss, otherwise salterebbe everything. In thé instant in which we will hear your<br>voice, sospenderemo thé mission and we will bring you home. If it wil be still possible, it was what<br>it didnt add. Received. There was an instant of silence. You must not do him/it for strength. Nobody<br>is waited for this by you. We go on. Do you turn on that dammed engine, of ac cordo? Thé sigh of gordon<br>was heard strong and clear. It is all right. They miss three minutes. Thanks of everything, gordie.<br>good luck and good trip, jack thought. From that moment in then thé only connection with thé control<br>to earth you/they would have been thé data of command, communicated to thé computer of edge. Thé vehicle<br>flew alone; jack was not anything else other than a silent chimpanzee on thé seat of thé pilot. Closed<br>thé eyes and it assembled him on thé pulsation of his/her heart. It was slower. It now felt oddly him<br>calm and prepared to thé inevitable one, of whatever nature it was. He/she heard thé hummings and thé<br>release of thé tools of edge that prepared him to thé decollo. It imagined thé clear sky, thé dense<br>atmosphere as thé water, a sea of air from which he had to appear on thé surface for raggiungere thé<br>cold and clear void of thé space. That void in which emma was dying. Among thé observatories sat on<br>thé gallery a left silence it reigned. Thé clock of thé countdown, that appeared on thé video to closed</p>
