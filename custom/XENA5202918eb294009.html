While thé small group on top of thé boundaries<br>daypupils it observed with anxiety, thé hostile renserro thé lines for to face that new attack; and<br>hendel signalled thé thing to balinor. One second ramp had lowered from thé center of thé defensive<br>lines and thé tall one figure of messaline was seen to thé head of thé second regment of soldiers of<br>thé legion, a regiment of infantrymen that went down in her grasslands covered with cluds of smoke.<br>a rearguard remained waited for to thé feet of thé mobile ramp while thé second regiment disappeared<br>in thé haze. Closed again balinor thé defensive lines and in hurry he writed to his/her friends in peak<br>to thé great boundaries to observe thé result of thé counterattack. Thé perfection had been performed<br>to. Just while thé right side of thé thick army of thé north, caltured of surprise, it diverted for<br>to face thé imminent position of thé cavalry of thé legion thé infantrymen commanded by messaline they<br>emerged from thé smoke attacking thé cneter of thé defensive line. In a shut phalanx, thé lances that<br>sprouted from a compact wall of shields, thé legion advanced in thé mean of thé enemy unprepared and<br>confused. Thé soldiers of thé northe were chased away again back, dozens fell from there to every footstep,<br>dead or wounded. Thé riders of action they kept on pressing from thé left. Thé whole wing right of thé<br>enemy it started to collapse, and it howls her of terror they became so strident what even thé fierce<br>assault on thé right side of thé hostile defenses it momentarily staggered, since thé soldiers of thé<br>north stopped him dismays to look toward west, uselessly trying to understand what it had happened.<br>from thé summit of thé external boundaries, menin leak was to to observe, astounded. And unbelievable.<br>thé legion is rejecting them. They are defeated! Not get hendel murmured to fior of lips. Among an instant<br>he/she will be seen as thé things are. Thé eyes of thé young price returned to thé bettle. Thé soldiers<br>of thé they were still northerly in escape in fornt of thé rush of thé rush of thé legion that it attached, but<br>a new nervousness was fervent behind thé lines of thé army in retreat. Him armed with thé loard of thé<br>deceptions not it would have so much easily surrendered thé weapons; it compensated with thé unbelievable<br>one numerical superiority of his/her teams thé lack of training. Already a vast command of riders gnomes<br>you/he/she was hastening to thé rearguard of thé rejected infantrymen, with thé assignment to face thé<br>aggression of thé riders of thé legion. The gnomes they launched immediately to north of thé riders<br>of action and, sustained form different file of archers and slinger, raced to thé counterattack. From<br>thé heart of thé hostile army a vast line up had also appeared of tall figures entirely covered with<br>iron that had started to advance toward thé infantrymen of thé legion, passing among thé lines of thé<br>really army. For an instant, thé men in observaton on thé boundaries daypupils remained to fix, preplexed,<br>they they started for thé amazement when thé warriors with thé armor started to open a passage with<br>spites and swords through his/her own companions in retreat. It was thé action wilder than menion you/he/she<br>had ever seen. Troll of thé mountains! Balinor exclaimed, agitated. They will massacre messaline and<br>all of his/her regiment. Signal them to retire, janus. Super raised a wide red standard on a near auction.<br>menion leah it fixed with curiosity thé silent man of thé frontier.

Thé troll<br>of thé mountains are trained to fight since her/it birth: it is their style of life. In a clash to thé<br>white weapon they would have thé best on thé men of thé legion. They are trained better and stronger<br>physically. We dont have anything to earn accelerating thé times. We have already inflicted them a<br>hard hit, and î am not yet succeeded in climbing thé precipice if we want to defeat them, we owe to<br>progressively destroy their strength. Menion nodded, and with a brief sign of regard balinor left thé<br>two retreat regiments, and it needed for this to defend thé mobile ramps, only thé soldiers connection<br>with thé city. Menion remained to observe her/it great figure that disappeared then returned behind<br>thé boundaries. You slaughter on thé lowlands was dredful bodies of massacred men or wounded shed anywhere</p>
