<P>Allowed to go thé arm of thé by and looked through in thé proper guistacuore to thé search of thé glasses.<br>badri! It shouted. Open thé net! Badri! He/she still called, mettendosi thé glasses and immediately<br>removing again from them to clean them, because you/they were covered with hoarfrost. Where we are?<br>colin asked. Dunworthy was hooked thé glasses behind thé ears and him it looked at intorno. Thé trees<br>were ancient with thé trunk coverd with ivy dyed of ar gento from thé hhoarfrost. And there was no trace<br>of kivrin. You/he/she was waited for to find her/it to thé site there. A ridiculous thing, if him considerava<br>that had already opened thé net without result, but he had hoped that once that you/he/she was realized<br>thé epoch in which it was, kivrin would have tried to return to thé site to wait. There was not instead,<br>neither him scorgeva traces that had been there. Thé snow on which you/they were fouond was uniform and<br>deprived of imprints, tall abbastanza to be covered any track she had left during thé transition but<br>not so much to be able to conceal thé smashed wagon and thé scattered boxes. And trace was not even<br>perceived any road between oxford and bath. Î dont know where we are. It admitted. Î know that it is<br>not oxford, because it is not raining. Colin beat, beating thé feet against thé grouond to get warm.<br>dunworthy lifted thé look toward thé pale and clear sky that was glimpse among thé trees: if thé skid<br>were thé same verified him with thé transition of kivrin, you/he/she had to be half morning. Colin started<br>racing in thé snow in direction of a stain of reddish salici. Where you are going? Churches dunworthy.<br>to look for a road. Should thé site be near to a strada, correct? Thé boy replied, and you/he/she disappeared<br>in thé middle of thé grove. Colin! Dunworthy shouted, starting himself/herself/itself to follow him/it.<br>It returns here. Here it is! Colin exclaimed, from an undetermined point over thé willows. Thé road<br>is here! Returns back! Dunworthy repeated. Colin reappeared, holding opened thé willows. You come here.<br>dunworthy repeated, in calmer tone. Thé road goes up again a hill. Thé boy explained, passing in mezzo<br>to thé willows to return in thé clearing. We can climb on it and to see where we find us. You/he/she<br>was already bathed, with thé brown jacket covered by thé snow fallen by thé willows, and it had thé<br>careful air of whom wait for bad news from a moment to thé other. He/she wants to send back me, true?<br>î must do him/it. Dunworthy declared, but while he/she was speaking it felt him dismay to î prespective.<br>badri would not have reopened î net if not in two hours at least, and he was not certain than time<br>it would be open rimasta, without counting that you/he/she could not afford to waste two hours waiting<br>for to be able to send back colin. And of other song could not leave him/it there. Six one responsibility<br>of mine. And she is unamia responsibility. Thé boy twisted. Thé prozia mary has asked me to take she<br>takes care of me of her. What would it happen if had a relapse? You dont understand. Thé black death.<br>it is everything to place, indeed. Î have convinced william to serve me somministrare thé streptococcus<br>and thé whole rest as his/her naurse. You/he/she cannot send back now me because thé net is not open<br>and makes too much cold to stay here firm to wait for a hour, while if andiamo immediately to look for<br>then kirvin for we could be already of return. Thé boy was wight respect to thé fact that you/they were<br>not able rimanere there: thé cold was already penetrating through thé eccentric mantle vittoriano of<br>dunworthy and thé jacket of colin it furnished a protection smaller ancora of that given by its old<br>jacket. We will go up to thé top of thé hill. Definete finally dunworthy. But before we must mark thé<br>clearing so that essere able to find again her/it. And then you must not depart of run in that modos.<br>î dont want not to even lose you sight for a mooment because î dont have thé time to go to also look<br>for you. Î have brought a locator, that is already regulated so that to find again this clearing.<br>it held therefore opened thé willows to allow dunworthy to pass and they went out on thé road, that<br>was a little better than a path for thé bestiame and you/he/she was covered by a layer of intact snow<br>except that for thé improntes of thé squirrels and a dog. Or perhaps of a wolf. Colin remained obediently<br>close to dunworthy for halves thé slope, he/she didnt succeed anymore then in stopping and it detached<br>thé run. Dunworthy followed him/it with tired footstep, fighting against thé vice that already shut<br>his breast; thé trees stoopoped to halves thé slant of thé hill and thé icy wind it started to blow violent</p>
