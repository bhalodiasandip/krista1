<P>For. Dollars. It absolutely was not as powerful as her big cars but you/he/she could be employed for<br>an ample variety of applications. In eight years, offering a vast gam but of computer of different dimensions,<br>thé dec î become a firm from, million dollars. Twenty years after thé intuition of olsen î start to<br>lose hits. He dident succeed in foreseeing thé future of thé small computers from table and at thé end<br>costreffo came to leave thé dec party, her his/her legend now concerns thé fact that and become famous<br>for possession repeatedly, and in public liquidated thé personal computer as a momentary fashion. Histories<br>as that of olsens make me reflect. It was extremely bright him to perceive new results and than after<br>having been four years a innovating and allowed to escape a great turn. Another man of notable creativeness<br>then all of sudden î stumble it was an wang chinese irnmigrato that imposed thé wang laboratories<br>as principal supplier of calculating elettro niche in thé sixties. In the following decade î ignore<br>thé suggestions of all those that surrounded him/it and î abandon thé market of thé calculators really<br>to thé eve of thé awento of a lower part competition cost that would have ruined him. One genial movement.<br>wang reinvento his/her firm transforming her in thé greatest producer of cars for thé elaboration of<br>thé texts. In thé seventies, thé terminals of elaboration of thé texts of thé wang started to take thé<br>place of thé mac slopes to write in thé offices of thé whole world. Ouesti termi nalis contained a microprocessor<br>but they were not true for sonal computer in how much projekted to make an alone thing: thé elaboration<br>of thé texts. Wang was a very creative technician. That intuition that you/he/she had pushed him to<br>abandon thé calculators you/he/she would have been able thé road that poffa to tomorrow to conduct him/it<br>in thé eighties to thé success in thé software for thé personal computer him perb didnt succeed in<br>individualizing thé tendency goes that thé sector would have taken. Wang had svilup pato excellent<br>software, but it was exclusively tied up to thé his/her words processors and therefore destined to thé<br>disappearance with thé apparition of thé personal non specialized computer that you/they could make<br>to turn applications of treatment of thé texts co me word star, word perfect and multi mate what they imitated<br>for prio his/her software. If wang had recognized thé impor tanza of thé compatibility of thé applications<br>software, prehaps there would not be today a microsoft î could be a mat matico or an awocato from<br>some part and my scorre aes ado lescenzia ls in thé world of thé computer science would stay little<br>anymore what an a distant personal memory. Also another firm of great relief, ibm, didnt know to gather<br>thé technological changes to the beginnings of thé revolution of thé pc to thé guide of thé society<br>there had been thomas j. Watson, definite man, ex seller of recorders of box. From a technical point<br>of view watson was not thé founder of ibm, but, thanks to his/her aggressive managerial style to thé<br>beginning of thé an ni thirty, ibm was reached to dominate thé market of thé rnacs bookkeeping slops.<br>lot of firms of thé sector in struggle for thé leadership. Up to every model of compu ter, also of a<br>same producer, you/he/she was planned as only and it asked for a proper operating system and a really<br>application software. N operating system turned to denominates to diskoperating system,or simply dos<br>and thé software fundamental that coordinates thé components of thé system of thé computer, tells them<br>as to collaborate and also performs other functions. Without it a computer and unusable. N siste but<br>operational and a base on which you/they are built all the programs software for thé application as<br>her with tabilita, thé book pays, thé elaboration of thé mail elet tronica. To different<br>levels of price thé computers were projected in lezio? Idllindustnl of thé computer different way. some<br>models were studied for g thé ambiens you scientificacademic, others for thé commerce. How sco prii<br>when î wrote thé basic for various personal computer, oc it raced a binding job to move thé software<br>from a model of computer to another. this was also verified when thé software was written in a standard<br>language co me thé cobol o thé fortran. Under thé guide of thé young tom, as his/her child and successor<br>of watson you/he/she was called,the firm betted million dollars on thé unpublished concept of architecture<br>scalabile: all thé computers of thé family sy steml, to put aside from thé dimensions, would have rispo<br>î am to thé instruction sets.
