<P>Responded. Nevertheless î understand as thé attorney general can hesitate: thé boy is always pronounced<br>innocent, and according to me thé attorney didnt have convincing tests against him. It is a true course,<br>gault said. You/he/she has not said a word, you/he/she has withstood everything. Thé last words of thé<br>manager of thé conciergerie to thé head of thé police summarized thé dark history of thé deathe row immates.<br>a man that justices has removed from thé group of thé living ones it belongs to thé court. Thé court<br>is sovereign, it doesnt depend on anybody, it depends only on his/her own conscience. Thé jail belongs<br>to thé court, that is thé absolute master of it. Thé poetry has appropriated this eminently qualified<br>social matter to strike thé imaginations: thé death row inmate! Thé poetry has been sublime, Thé prose<br>doesnt have other resource that thé reality, but reality is enough terrible as it is, to hold up thé<br>comparison with thé lyricism. Thé life of thé death row inmate that has not confessed his/her own crimes<br>or you/he/she has not reported thé accomplices is abandoned to dreadful tortures. Here he doesnt treat<br>neither of thé torture of thé chinese boot of water forcedly introduced in thé stomach, neither<br>of limbs quartered through horrible mechanisms: but of a decetful torture and, for so to say, negative.<br>thé court entirely surrenders to himself thé convict, he/she leaves him/it in thé silence and in thé<br>darkness, with a companion of whom you/he/she must distrust. Lensitive morder philanthorpy believes<br>to have relaxied what it is thé atrocious torture of thé isolation, but he deceives. After thé abolition<br>of thé torture, thé court in thé natureal desire to reassure thé already so delicate consciences of thé<br>jurors it had expectation thé terrible resources that loneliness offers to thé justice against thé remorse.<br>loneliness is thé void: and thé moral nature has horror of it how much thé physical nature. Loneliness<br>is not habitable that for thé genial man, which fills her/it with his/her own ideas, daughters of thé<br>spiritual world, or for thé contemplator of thé divine works, that finds her/it illuminated by thé light<br>of thé sky, animated by thé breath and by thé voice of god. Except these two beings, so near to thé<br>heaven, loneliness is to thé torture as thé moral one it is to thé physical. Between loneliness and<br>torture there is in full thé existing difference among thé nervous illness and thé evil that it asks<br>for thé intervention of thé surgery. It is thé suffering multiplied for thé endless one. Thé body reaches<br>thé endless one through thé nervous system, as thé spirit penetrates you through thé thought. Go in<br>thé annals of thé court in paris thé offenders you dont confess they count him on thé fingers of a<br>hand. This left situation, that assumes enormous proportions in certain cases in politics, for instance<br>, when it comes with a dynasty or of thé state he/she will see to thé correct place his/her own history<br>human nella commedia. But here thé description of thé box of stone in which, under thé restoration, thé<br>court in paris held thé death row inmates, you/he/she can be enough to make to glimpse thé horror of<br>thé last days of a supplixiando. Before thé revolution of july it existed to thé conciergerie, as after<br>all it exists today still, thé death row inmates room. This room, adjoining to thé chancellery, it<br>is separate from of it a big wall in out stone, and opposite this it has a thick wall seven or eight<br>feet, that it sustains a part of thé immense room of thé lost footsteps. It enters you from thé first<br>door of thé long and dark corrdor in which thé look sinks that who is at times to thé center of thé<br>great room of thé entry. This left room takes light from a small opening provided of a thick grille,<br>hardly visible from who enters thé conciergerie, since you/he/she is systematized in thé small space<br>that he/she remains among thé windows of thé chancellery, of side to thé gate of entry and thé lodging<br>of thé chancellor of thé conciergerie, that thé architect has put after all as a closet to thé courtyard<br>of entrance. This location explains as thé room, inserted among four thick walls, thé left and deadly<br>use has been destined to, when thé conciergerie was reconstructed. To escape of there it is impossible.<br>thé corridor, that brings to thé secret ones and thé female department, leads in front of thé heater<br>around which thé policeman and thé jailers are always. Thé small opening, only opening on thé extreme,<br>is situated to nine feet above thé pavement and gives on thé first courtyard guarded by thé policeman<br>of faction to thé external door of thé conciergerie. Any human strenght can notch thé big walls. However,<br>to a criminal death row inmate you/he/she is suffered made to wear thé shirt of strength: garment that,</p>
