<P>Thé motors are still in good state and can have turned on with a brief warning. And qualé thé use of<br>these information? Churches kerk. Be, he/she is never known. you/he/she could come useful. Controllo<br>communications to pyrrus one. Do you feel me? In an instant jason was close to thé radio and turned<br>on her/it. Here é pyrrus one. Quale your message? We have received a single from thé battleship on thé<br>langhezza of wave of. Thé message is thé following: nederuebla to thé navigacio center. Kroniku there<br>tio sangon: î dont succeed in understanding him/it. It said destination. It is esperanto thé ancient<br>language of thé empire. Thé ship has simply sent an education of change of rout to thé control of navigation.<br>and we know his/her name. Thé indistrutti bile. And is this important? Yes that is him/it! Jason howked<br>of joy while it was inserting thé new wavelength in thé control of thé communications. Once that you<br>have convinced someone to speak to you, thé bargain you/he/she is done to half. Ask him/it to whatever<br>dealer. And now, if you dont regret it, you maintain an absolute silence, while î put my good military<br>slang in esperanto into practice. It voided thé glass of wine, thé throat cleared him and turned on<br>thé radio. Ready, indestructible, here it is thé general quartier of thé fleet. You explain thé none<br>authorized change of rout. Change of rout authorized by thé instructions I, to avoid thé destruction.<br>thé new rout brings to a riskey navigation. Ritornare on thé preceding rout. Isecondis passed silent<br>while they were observing thé screen; then thé purple shine of thé rockets illuminated thé bow of thé<br>ship. Have made her! It shouted happy destination giving him loving embrace that almost broke his<br>ribs. He/she takes orders from you. Now say to leave us to him to enter. Î dont believe that it will<br>be so easy, for which leaves that i/you/he/she take thé thing to thé distant one. You turned again to<br>thé computer in esperanto. Change of satisfactory rout. To explain thé reason for thé recent thick energy<br>consumption. Rain of meteorites. All thé meteors in orbit of collision have been destroyed. You records<br>thé use of thé secondary batteries of missiles: is it esatto? It is exact. Your reserves of ammunitions<br>must be scare. Verranno sent of thé restocking. Now necessary restocking. Reserves still about thé<br>level of restocking. Polemic to be a computer, true? Jason said tenendo thé hand on thé microphone.<br>but î will make to be worth thé degree and vedremo if it will work. Thé general quartier dosent corroborate<br>you decision on thé rifornimentis. A ship with thé escorts will be to thé porthole of load among diciassette<br>times. To confirm. Confirmed. Thé aircraft of restocking must give thé segnale of revocation of thé<br>disttivagione before entering thé ray of two hundred kilometers. Affirmative. Thé signal will be sent.<br>qualé thé signal in use? Thé answer was not immediate and jason lifted thé fingers incrociate, while<br>thé silence extended him for almost two seconds. Negative. Thé information cannot be furnished. To get<br>ready for a control of memory of thé signal of revoca of thé disattivazione. Is it a simple signal radio?<br>affirmative. It is spoken sentence? negative. It is a signal in code. Affirmative. Poured me by to<br>drink. It said microphone extinguished jason. This game of questions and answers you/he/she can go for<br>thé long ones. And it was this way. But a patient job, turning around thé argomento, it furnished piece<br>for piece thé necessary information. Jason extinguished thé radio showed thé scribbled sheets. Finally<br>something. Thé signed in code is a number in base ten. If we send thé correct number, thé disattivazione<br>immediately annuls him and thé ship passes under our control. And money is ours. It said destination.<br>our computer can be programmed for sending a series of numbers antil it doesnt guess that correct?<br>you/he/she can be done and same idea had come me really now. Thé indestructible one thinks that a control<br>of thé communications we are dong and it says that you/he/she can accept up to seven hundred signals<br>to thé seconds to repeat and to verity. Our computer will read thé signals back and will give confirmation<br>of each. But naturally all thé signals must pass for thé circuits of discrimination and if thé correct<br>signal will be sent, thé defenses of thé state of disattivazione out verranno. This seems me such an<br>obvious makeup that not ingannerebbe not even a five year old child. Kerk said. To never underestimate<br>thé stupidity of a computer. You dimentichi that is absolutely a deprived car of in immaginazione. Now<br>allowed to see me if this system will serve as to something. Quickly it started to press keys, then<br>it mumbled an imprecazione and it threw a kick to thé console. Nothing to be done. Douremmo to make</p>
