Thé case ended on thé newspapers, someone followed thé manifesto that since<br>december you/he/she had spoken of thé forgotten of tan gentopoli, gamberale was submerged by letters<br>of people what he/she didnt see from decades and one appeal of his to one hundred men of culture had<br>answered sessantacinque.

Accusation and defence should have<br>thé same po teri, thé same possibilities of intervention. î have experimented that thé burden of thé<br>test doesnt touch to thé accusation. It is l burden of thé hymn cenza that is up to thé defense. Thé<br>worse condition in which can be an accused it is to defend from innocent. If in thé my life of manager<br>i/you had made a fit solo of those that î have subito i, would not be a manager anymore.
