<P>Gunta; well dressed in one work day. Thé thing seemed, neither more neither less, amazing. Thé beret<br>was very elegant, thé giacchetta of blue cloth, fitted tightly and buttoned, it seemed new and impeccable<br>as thé pants. It had even thé shoes, even if it was friday and thé tie, a bit of ribbon from thé vivacious<br>color. It had such a city air to do yes that tom was consumed thé liver. How much more tom fixed that<br>wonder, how much more you/he/she curled thé nose in front of so much elegance, so much more miserable<br>they seemed to become hi/her cloths, None of thé two boys spoke. It thé one stirred, thé other one<br>did thé same: but only of side, in circle. And they always stayed of forehead continually fixing. himself/herself/itself<br>in thé eyes. Tome finally, said: can give you of it a fracco! Î would like that î tried there. Be, î<br>can do him/it. And î say that you are not able. Yes that î am able. No, you are not able. Î am able.<br>you are not able. Î am able. No. An embarrassing silence. Then tom said: as you call yourself? This<br>is a thing that doesnt concern yourself, perhaps. And instead î can do so that you concern me, î could<br>bet us. Be, because i/you/he/she dont try us? If you tell him/it once more î try there. Î repeat him/it,<br>i repeat him/it, i repeat him/it! Here is fact. Ah, creeds to be furbone, true? Î could give her for<br>you with a tied up hand behind thé back, If î wanted. Be, because not me thé from the? You tell him/it<br>to be able to give her for me. It is what î will do, if you take around me. Ok, yes: î have seen whole<br>families in thé pies as you. Witty! Do you believe to be who knows who, eh? Ok, that beautiful tipetto!<br>you must send him/it down, this tipetto, even if you dont like it. Î challenge you to touch me, because<br>whoever dares to do him will be tanned for thé parties. Are a liar! And you are him/it more than me!<br>you beat only yourself to words, but you dont dare to do him/it seriously. Oh, it walks: go! you<br>feel: if you continue with these fanfaronates, î take a stone and î beat him/it to you on thé head.<br>oh, sure. You can be certain of it. Be, because you dont do him/it then? Why do you keep on saying<br>that will do him/it? Do you want to know why you dont do him/it? Because you are afraid. Î am not afraid.<br>yes that you have him. Î dont have him. You have him. Still a silence, with other adocchiamenti, and<br>other to turn around story. Of there to not very, they came to be shoulder against shoulder. From said:<br>vattene of here! Vattene you! Î wont go. Î wont even go. And so they remained, each with a foot placed<br>to angle, to me of prop, each pushing with all of hi/her strengths, and both looking at thé other<br>with hate. But two nobody succeeded in prevailing. After having pushed up to be both sweaty ones and<br>î turned on in face, they were relaxed both with careful caution,and tom said: six a coward and a pup.<br>î will tell of you my great brother, he can give her for you with thé finger little finger, and î will<br>do so that gives her for you, for junta. That î care of your great brother? Î have a brother that is<br>bigger than him: not only, but you/he/she can also make him/it fly beyound that fence. Both his/her brothers<br>were imaginary. This is a lie. Thé fact that you tell him/it doesnt mean that it is him/it. From traced<br>a line on thé dust of thé road with thé alluce and said: î challenge you to overcome this line: fault<br>and î crush you so much that you wont succeed in being standing anymore. Whoever dares to do him/it<br>here it will pay. Thé new come it immediately went beyond thé line and it said: before, you have said<br>that you would have done him/it, lets see now if will do him/it! Hey, not to crush me thé calluses;<br>you would do well to be careful. Be, you have said that you would have done him/it: why dont you do<br>him/it? My goodness, î would also do him/it for two cents. Thé new come it removed from him of pocket<br>two copper monetines and it handed you her, mocking. Tom made her fall to thé ground with a hit of the<br>had. An instant and thé two boys were rolling on thé dust, grasped as cats; and, for one whole minute<br>they were pushed, throwing himself/herself/itself for thé hair and thé suits, releasing himself/herself/itself<br>fists, scratching himself/herself/itself does her/it and covering himself/herself/itself of dust cloud<br>and of glory. Thé confusion finally assumed a form and, through thé mist of thé battle, tom appeared<br>sat astride on thé new boy and intent to bombard him/it with hail of fists. Thouts enough! It said.<br>thé boy wriggled him trying to free. You/he/she was crying. above all for thé anger. Thouts enough!<br>and thé hammering continued. Finally thé stranger he allowed to escape a smothered enough! And tome left<br>that he raised again and you/he/she said: well, this will server you from lesson. Thé neighbor turns</p>
