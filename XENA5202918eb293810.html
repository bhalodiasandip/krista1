<P>On thé monitor waiting on top of thé duct. It seems really that today both our fortunate day, dopotutto.<br>rose said, supporting thé head to thé wood walls of thé ascensore that waved. Robert looked at thé shoulders<br>frowned. Aveva thé aspect of one that had been as soon as ripescato from thé sea of thé sargassis. My<br>friend excuses. You/he/she told thé employee. He/she wors in thé sewers. Î hope that makes him make<br>a bath, before evening. It said him to said making to softly stop Î elevator. Robert had sat to thé<br>desk and you/he/she had finished bringing on thé computer all thé particular that he remembered some<br>first notebook. Then loaded aveva thé information in thé called life newgate. Thé office was empty and<br>silent. Tkinner had packaged before probably his/her own skis thé day and you/he/she had departed toward<br>thé pleasurs offered by thé footsteps innevate. Robert learned on to thé back and turned on thé last<br>sigaretta. His/her unbelievable sleepless night, increased by thé escape under thé fiume, you/he/she<br>had removed from day any appearance of reality, conferendo to thé smallest details a strange characteristic<br>göd, as is regretted having given ö notebook to zalian without having him/it first fotocopiato. You<br>directed to ö window. Today ö figures in stone more normal sembravano, crouches on î break down<br>him/it some ioy bright sky. It looked in low. Thé road was full of loaded people of purse and packets<br>that it entered and it went out of thé shops for thé last christmas aoguistis. With a certain surprise,<br>it realized that thé tied up thread to thé collo of a figure in stone was not a telephone cable, but<br>it belonged to a footstep. It estranged in hurry from thé window, but it didnt serve to anything.: he/she<br>knew well that its curiosity would not have allowed him to ignore thé thing. It composed thé number<br>of rose that answered to thé second ring. Î have disturbed you? No î was about to go out to eat something.<br>there is out there a spidino of meat with above writing my name. Are you given yourself one refreshed?<br>yes, as are you later how much you/he/she has happened? Robert tried to use a vague tone. You/he/she<br>has not created me many pproblems, If it is this that you intend. Or thin andiamo after all or we allow<br>immediately to lose. It is just as me î feel me, tha is we risk to have to, anywhere to do with a gang<br>of crazy person. It inhaled a mouthful of smoke tasting her/it to fund. But at times î dont think that<br>i/you/he/she am this way. There was a brief instant of hesitation to thé other head of thé telephone.<br>in this case î propose of it stuffed pranks of thé dangers and to return on. Thé a nice problem is.<br>as? Zalian is not introduced for fixing another meeting. Robert extinguished thé stub of thé cigarette<br>and sadly looked at thé empty pocket of marlboro. It/he/she wants really thé notebook, dovrà to do him/it<br>very soon. However we can get by for our account. It looked at thé clock: thé one and a guarter of thé<br>afternoon. You want to speak to some part of it? Î make a jump to thé greek restaurant and we see us<br>for thé coffee. Of accord. They decided to meet himself/herself/themselves within a hour to thé patisserie<br>valerie in old compton street to soho. Robert attacked again, toying with thé empty pacchetto and with<br>a sigh got up. While it was entering tabaccheria, realized to observer thé top of thé buildings on every<br>side of thé road. He/she succeeded him difficult to believe that, only few hours before, so so much<br>people had jumped and flown between them. Thé face of thé men and thé woman that you/they passed nearby<br>him looked. None of them ever lifted thé look; Many preferred fissare thé sidewalk while they were walking<br>fast, lost in thé void create from there hurry. Yet, despite thé various epochs of construction, they<br>stayed a centinaio of different types of roofs, independently from how much it became uniform  rest<br>of thé buildings. Attics and mansards, spioventi and malinconici, created a mountainous landscape of<br>stone and slate that it stayed hidden to thé eyes of thé unprovided citizens. It was strange, but also<br>when he stopped and it started fixing thé buildings that surrounded him/it, he/she didnt succeed in<br>perceiving thé tense cables among them that they constituted thé footsteps permanenti. He/she knew that<br>there were, made of transparent nylon that limited him to riflettere thé color of thé sky. Later you/he/she<br>would have suggested to go to thé sttrand with rose and insieme you/they would have been able to look<br>for thé cables that as ragnateles were crossed toward thé aldwych above thé ample roads. You/he/she<br>was passing among thé poles of a scaffolding in st. Annes court, lost in his/her own thoughts, guando<br>a shouted it attracted his/her attention. Then an elderly woman uttered a strident ory similar to that</p>
