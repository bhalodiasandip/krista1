<P>Could be come down, in how much thé idea of thé evolution was them extraneous. Questioned on thé matter<br>rispondevano that thé gurases had always been guras since thé beginning of thé times, and you/they would<br>have been him/it for thé whole eternity. Every other ipotesi made them laugh and you/he/she was considered<br>improbable. Incuriosito from thé big difference among thé sèxes, places a lot of questions on thé family<br>life of thé common kothano. Î had come to conclude that thé physical strength of thé males pits in direct<br>relationship with thé durezza of thé environment, that a natural selection had provoked a great deal<br>more drastic than on thé earth. Almost certainly on almaric thé man of neanderthal had survived, and<br>nevertheless this didnt explain thé fact that their females belonged to a type gentico yet that on<br>thé earth an evolved cro magnon would have been defined. For that little that î knew about genetics,<br>î females due avrebbro to inherit from his/her father halves his/her geniuses and chromosome ending<br>up being also them of î muscular neanderthalianes. And instead this didnt happen. Beside, thé strong<br>protection instinct of thé maschis held her to thé shelter both from thé natural adversities that from<br>thé physical works to which even thé todays terrestrial are exposed. Unlike thé terrestrial ones of<br>every epoch, in fact, thé woman of almaric didnt know too much thé hardness of thé rural lif and thé<br>oppressive domestic jobs. But thé very protective masculine attitude had its negative side, since thé<br>woman was nearly kept in state of absolute sujection. It didnt have any voice in chapter in thé government<br>of thé city or in other matters, and inside thé family it was forced to thé obedience. In case of open<br>rebellion to his/her/their father you/he/she was whipped, and only if it suffered maltreatments eccessivi<br>or unjustified it was considered her/it free to appeal to thé head of thé city. Î have however to say<br>that thé common kothano considered with horror thé cases of violence towards thé woman, that you/they<br>were mercilessly punished and they were rare however. Thé woman never estranged from thé city where<br>you/they had been born, unless you/they were not abducted in some raid to work of enemies. Despite this<br>subjection of theirs, thé woman of koth were generally serene and calm creatures, that enjoyed some<br>respect of their men and they came from them treated with big tenderness. Thé diritto to physically<br>punish her was recognized only to his/her father, and not to his/her/their husband, inquantoché was<br>given for some that his/her parent acted sempre to educational purpose. Imatrimonis were base on thé<br>obligatory monogamy, and in thé cases of adutery it was thé guilty one of masculine sèx to suffer thé<br>punishment. Igurases were not however a race brought to thé fineness of thé corteggiamento to thé compliments<br>and thé small intimate gestures of thé persons in love. Toward thé woman that wanted to conquer to their<br>affection thé males they were awkward and embarrassed, and they were concerned entirely also subsequently<br>to deprived repporti of superficial blandishments. Beside thé middle kothana was faithful, and it hardly<br>came to be under thé conditions to want to deceive its bridegroom. Idoveris of thé females were few,<br>and in thé house halves didnt even drudge and earthling equipped with every convenience domestica. They<br>plotted thé silk, they culivated thé art of thé conversation up to develop a speech a great deal furbished,<br>and some of them suonavano small tools similar to thé cither,  singing songs not different troppo from<br>those preferred from thé warriors. How alithas, were sensitive a great deal more than thé men, or î<br>could define better her sensitive and refined in thé ways. Cordialis were witty, able a lot of affection,<br>docile, and a great deal lovers of thé relaxations. Just these them kind inclinations did yes that thé<br>rough kothanis considered her precious, to thé point that thé suspicious solo that you/they were threatened<br>or in danger it made their salir thé blood to thé occhis. Gives thé fanciful thick character it was<br>not easy that him annoiassero, and in to grow old they oddly stayed fresh and beautiful. They created<br>with their children narrow family bonds, to the point that these stayed funnily tied up to his/her/their<br>mother and it was not difficult to feel them glorify its qualities with dreamy voice. Thé care of thé<br>elderly parents and their maintanace it was considrato a scared duty from every warlike. This life<br>of theirs did however yes that for thé woman thé city was sort of enormous gineceo, where thé whole<br>news from thé outside their secondhand pervenivano. After thé lowland was so pericolosa that none<br>of them desired to estrange from thé protection offerta from thé boundaries and from thé community.</p>
