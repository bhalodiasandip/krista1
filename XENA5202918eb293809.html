<P>Not it could excessively odbiegac from terrestrial rule. But powiedzial itself hunt kind, to which nalezal<br>harlie, musial gdzies ewolwowac az to their terrestrial form. It was guite selfevident, with which<br>gdzies znajdowalo or on earth, or not on earth. Elementary right logic not dopuszozaly other mozliwosci<br>doctor zaozal zastannawiac over all, what was able itself przypomniec from generally przyjetego thé picture<br>of thé evolutionses of thé terrestrial forms of life. In result embraced his doubt, of or though huge<br>efforts and ladan which inches of generation showed a light to owemu topic, not it could case ckazac,<br>which covers after him about many more, than itself till now with such confidence are imagined. From<br>each standpoint of a few billions of years this long period. Or is public meeting affair altogether<br>not to pomyslenia, with gdzies in this abyss niepewnsci does was place, to of przeoozyc inch to cable<br>development human kind, to cable which burst into bloom and die out about many earlier, than man contemporary<br>rezpoogal her development? On thé other side fact, which charliego are fouond on moon, nasuwal proposal<br>about thé existence of civilizations fullblown technoligioznie in such degree, to móo him there wyslac.<br>from pewnoscia, in order to stanac on road to thé invention of cosmic flights, had to beforehand dojsc<br>to fabrication total spoleozenstwa technologioznego. It zas had to konstuowac machines, uznosic buildings<br>and cities, obrabiac metals, and also pozostawic for itself thé every another signs of progress. If<br>on earth once existed such civilization, from inch pewnoscia in thé course of thé ages of expeditions<br>guestioning and excavations inevitable was will com across at last on her footprints. But are not<br>made a note even one such case. ehociaz proposals leant exclusively on negative proofs, even hunt, by<br>whole swej sklonnosci treatment every gagadnien without galozen from mouontain taken, not could uznac,<br>with concusion about thé existence of such civilization had even if least praudopodobienstwo. Dozostawala<br>public meeting only mozliwoso: charlie came from somewhere else. Of course such place not could be moon:<br>was little too, to anywhere atrzymac on sufficiently long time atmoshphere indispensable to appearing<br>life at all, and that more also, to occurrence this osiagnelo high level. And and besides wind jacket<br>cosmic charliego commanded, with was he in that to place same strange, as terrestrial man. In this situation<br>she could this be only jakas another planet. But here pojawial thé problem of niewathliwic human body<br>charliego, what caldwell underlined, choo not mial willingness zaglebiac in szozególy. According to<br>that, what universally are accepted, hunt wiedzial that evolution lawsuit executes in long periods by<br>selekoje thé outoomes of thé guite accidental serieses of genetic changes. Every recognized rights and<br>based dictated, with appearing two identical final products in two guite isolated evolutional remifications<br>developping in different recesses uszechswiata, merely not it could succeed. And so, if charlie pochodzil<br>from somewhere else, of whole azial accepted theories scientific musial runac in rubbles. And public<br>meeting charlie in no case could pochodzic from earth. But in no argument case could pochodzic znikadinad.<br>beside that charlie not mial rights istniec. But istnial. Doszedlszy to full proposals from whole affair,<br>hunt bezglosnie zagwizdal. Zawieraly because of dosc materials, to to throw in scientific world in spores<br>on thé inches of decade. In institute biological westood on caldwella, lyn garland, hunta and graya<br>oczekiwal propessor christian danchekker. Englishmans recognized him, poniewaz caldwell already earlier<br>przedstawil them itself mutually by wideofon. In road to thé laboratotries of institute danchekker przekazal<br>their farther information. As on own age, body was excellently kept. Zawdzieozalo this environment,<br>in which zostalo found: free from bacteriums bezuzgledna vacancy about constant, outlines to thé low<br>temperature of environment which zapewniala even during lunar midday isolating bulk oslaniajacej thé<br>body of stone. In these conditions not he could in no form succeed thé bacterial dissolution of soft<br>tissues. Cosmic wind jacket was nowhere damaged. In connection with this for najprawdopodobniejsza now<br>theories are accepted damage of thé system of supporting of life, why cutoome was thé sudden fall of<br>thé temprature within of wind jacket. Body zostalo in brief time deep gamrozone, and this highspeed<br>tool steel thé reason of thé sudden interrupting of thé lawsuit of thé change of matter. Thé crystals<br>of ice uformowanego from fluids constitutional spowodowaly rozlegle thé rents of cell membranes. With<br>running of thé years of wiekszosc light matters submited sublimation, above all from plytszych thé layers</p>
