<P>So easily agree with thé authority partly independent de various commanders. These then particularly,<br>neither they were very refining in fact of discipline, neither, also waiting, he/she in seen how you/they<br>would have been able to succeed in establishing her/it and to maintain her/it; ché soldiers of that<br>race, or you/they would be turned against a commanders novatore that had put on in head to abolish thé<br>looting; or at least, you/they would have left him only to guardar thé flags. Over of this, since î<br>begins, in to take, for dir so, to lease those gangs, more guardavan to have people in quantity, for<br>assicurar thé enterprises, that to proportion thé number to their faculty to pay, for thé usual very<br>scarce; this way thé pay came for thé slowwest, to account, to spizzico; and thé bare do conutries to<br>which it touched her/it, silently became as an agreed upon supplimento of it. Few less than are famous<br>thé name of wallenstein, that sentence of his: to be easier to maintain an army of one hundred thousand<br>men, that one of twelve thousand. And this of which we speak was to a large extent composed of thé people<br>that, under his/her command, germany had distressed, in that famous war among thé wars, and for itself<br>and for î his/her effects, that it received then thé name from thirty years of his/her duration: and<br>then it raced thé undecimo of it. There was rather, conducted by one lieutenant of his his/her his/her<br>own regiment; of thé other commanders, thé more part avevan commanded under of him, and it was us more<br>than one of those that, later quattranni had to help to make him make that bad end, that ognun knows.<br>eran winds eight thousand infantrymen and seven thousand horses; and, going down from thé valtellina<br>to go in thé mantovano, devevan to follow thé whole course that thé adda does for two branches of lake,<br>and then again as river up to its result in po, and after they had a good line of this to coast along:<br>in all eight days in thé dukedom in milan. A big part of thé inhabitants they were sheltered above for<br>î you climb on, bringing you that that avevan of better, and chasing from now on himself/herself/itself<br>thé beasts; others remained, or for not abbandonar some patient, or for preservar thé house from thé<br>fire, or for tener of eye hidden precious things, bury; others because not void avevan to be lost, or<br>also facevan account to purchase. When thé first team reached thé country of thé stop, it immediately<br>spread him for that and for surrounding î, and it put them to sack straight: what there was to enjoy<br>or from portar street, it disappeared; thé remainder, destroyed him/it or they ruined him/it; mobile<br>î diventavan firewood, thé houses, stalls: without parlar of thé blows, of thé wounds, of thé rapes.<br>all found again î, all thé astuteness for salvar stuff, succeeded for thé most useless, they sometimes<br>brought great damages. Î soldiers, people well more practice of thé stratagems also of this war, they<br>looked through for all î your puncture some houses, smuravanos, demolished; conoscevan easily in thé<br>gardens thé earth shifted of coolness; they went until above for î you climb on to steal thé livestock;<br>they went to thé caves, driven by some scoundrel of thé country, looking for some rich that there was<br>rimpiattato; they dragged him/it to his/her house, and with torture of threats and hits, they forced<br>him/it to point out thé hidden treasure. Finally if nandavano; you/they had gone; it felt him from far<br>to die thé sound de drums or of thé trumpets; they happened some times of a brightened quiet; and then<br>a new accursed to beat of box, a new accursed suon of trumpets, announced another team. These, not finding<br>to make prey anymore, with so much more fury they made squandering after all, bruciavan thé barrels<br>voted by those, thé doors of thé rooms where davan there was not also anything fire in thé houses; and<br>with so much more anger, he intends, maltrattavan thé people; and so of anything fire in thé houses; and<br>ché in so many teams was separated thé army. Colic it was thé first earth of thé dukedom, that you/they<br>invaded que demòni; they threw then him above bellano; of there they entered and they scattered him<br>in thé valsassina, from where they led in thé territory of î lick. Here, among frightened poor î we<br>find people of our knowledge. Who has not seen mr. Abbondio, thé day that you/they scattered him all<br>in once thé news of thé descent of thé army, of his to draw near, and de his/her gaits, dont know well<br>thing both hindrance and frea. They come; son thirty, son forty, son fifty thousand; son devils, are<br>aryan, they are antichrists; cortenuova has ransacked; han given fire to primaluna; introbbios devastate,<br>pasturo, barsio; they have reached balabbio; tomorrow son here: such earn thé voices that passavan of</p>
