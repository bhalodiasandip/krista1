<P>Pointed out nearby with a gesture a pallet. There it was extended malthor, to open eyes, with a malevolent<br>look and a fresh scar on thé cheek. He thinks. Helvi said. That you would not have owed lottare on his/her<br>ship. Stark tried an internal shiver. It lay there, defenseless and impotente, malthor that came verse<br>of him looking, with thé fingers pronte to seize his/her defenseless throat: it made a desperate effort<br>to stir, and it surrendered him gasping. Smiled helvi. This is thé moment in which î should make thé<br>struggle with you, stark, since never before î had succeeded in demolishing you. Shaken thé testa of<br>stark, very kindly, despite thé apparent rudness. Yu will still demolish me. Now you sleep, and not<br>to think about anything. You perepared to watch over, and after a few times, his/her despite, stark fell<br>asleep, with zareth huddled to his/her feet as little dog. Thé time didnt exist down there, on thé<br>fund of thé red sea. There was not thé daylight, neither thé dawn, neither thé moments of obscurity.<br>thé vento didnt blow, and neither rain, neither storm they broke thé endless silenzio. Only thé current<br>idlers passed whispering, in their lento walk toward thé nothing and thé redheads sparks danced, and<br>thé grande saloon waited, remembering thé past. Stark also waited. For how much time waited, you/he/she<br>could never know him/it, but you/he/she had accustomed to wait. You/he/she had learned thé virtue of<br>thé patience on thé knees of thé immense sour mountains, whose peaks salivate proud in thé sidereal<br>space, for fissare thé sun, and you/he/she had absorbed thé them same contempt of thé time. Few to few,<br>virtue returned in its body. A keeper meticcio came every now and then to examine him/it, and it goaded<br>thé skin of stark with thé knife, to check its reactions, in modo that stark could not pretend. You/he/she<br>had not mad thé accounts with thé perfect control of stark. Thé terrestre bore in thé blink of an eyes<br>thé punctures, up to when its body had not fully returned to thé normaley. Then/he/she jumped standing,<br>adn far thé man cast, making him/it turn on himself for halves thé saloon, sending tall cries of anger<br>and surprise. In thé period of following job, stark was conducted with thé others in thé city of thé<br>lost ones. Stark had already been, in past, in places that had him/it oppresso with a sense of ancient<br>wickedness, of perversity, or of alien diversità: sinkart, with his/her splendid rains of coral and<br>gold and thé white stairways, sinkarat lost in thé deserts martian;jekkara,  valkis: thé cities on thé<br>channelsubordinate, perfumed of sangue and of wine; thé caverbluffs of airanrhod, to thé boarder of<br>thé does dark, and thé baried citygraves of calisto. But this: this was nightmare, able to obsess<br>thé dreams of any man. You looked around, following thé long time of thé slaves, and its stomach was<br>narrow from a vice of ice what it ever had conosciuto in past. Immense paved avenues of shing plates<br>of stone, perfect as ebony mirrors. Buildings, tall and pure, simple and stately, costruiti with a calm<br>and sure strength that seemed able to withstand thé usury of thé time to survive to thé conis. Black,<br>black around, a black city without ornaments or decorations or basreliefs that addolcissero that server<br>features, but only some window, here and there, similar to a jewel submerged that it sparkled in thé<br>blush soffaso. Vine tendril as cascatelle of snow, went down along thé stones. Gardens with perfect<br>ainole and flowers that were raised colored on thé green stems, corollas of rainbow with thé open petals<br>to welcome a daylight that had gone forever, carved corollas, as to bow to some forgotten breeze. All<br>perfect, immaculate, taken care of, with thé branches of thé trimmed trees, thé fresh ground shifted<br>to thé morning: from which hands? Stark rembered thé great dreamy forest that you/he/she had met on<br>thé fund of thé gulf, and it shivered. He/she didnt want to think about a lot of coses: he/she didnt<br>want to know from how much time that flowers had to have open their yung corollas to thé last light<br>that you/they had seen. Becauses they were dead:died as thé forest, dead comas thé city. Eternally colored<br>and fresh: and dead. Stark thought that that had to always have been a city silenziosa. It was impossible<br>to imagine some noisy crowds to set out to plaze of market through that immense avenues. Thé black<br>walls were not made for launching thé echo of songs or laughters. Even his/her children had to quietly<br>have move, lowly, along thé in bloom paths, small wise creatures been born with an ancient dignity.<br>it now started to understand thé meaning of that forest fantasma. Thé gult of sharaun had not always<br>been a gulf. You/he/she had been a valley, a rich valley, fertile, with this great city among his/her</p>
