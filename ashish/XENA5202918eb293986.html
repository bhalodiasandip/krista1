Voi will be for me<br>holy men: you wont eat thé meat of a beast torn to pieces in thé country, you will throw her/it to<br>thé dogs. Non will scatter false gossips; you wont lend hand to thé guilty one to be witness for an<br>injustice. Wont follow thé majority to act badly and you wont depose in trial to divert toward thé<br>majority to distort thé justice. Non wont even favor thé weak in his/her trial. Quando will meet thé<br>ox of your enemy or his/her donkey dispersed, you must bring back you them. When you will see thé donkey<br>of your enemy collapse under thé load not to surrender him/it to himself: put yourself with him to help<br>him/it. Non will make to divert thé judgment of thé poor man, that turns him to you in his/her trial.<br>ti will hold away from lying word. Dont make to die thé innocent one and thé correct one, because î<br>dont acquit thé guilty one. Non will accept gifts, because thé gift blinds who has thé open eyes and<br>it also perverts thé words of thé correct ones. Non will oppress thé stranger: also you know thé life<br>of thé stranger, because you have been foreign in thé country of egypt. Per six years you will sow your<br>earth and you will pick up thé prodotto, of it but in thé seventh year you wont exploit her/it and<br>you will leave her/it uncultivated: they will eat thé needy ones of it of your people and what will<br>leave you/he/she will devoured by thé beasts of thé country. This way you will do for your vineyard<br>and ofr your olivegrove. Per six days you will make your jobs, but in thé seventh day you will make<br>rest, because is able calm goder your ox and your donkey and can breathe thé children of your slave<br>and thé strenger. Farete attention to how much î have told you: not pronounce thé name of other déi;<br>dont fell on your mouth! Fre times a year you will make party in my honor: osserverai thé party of<br>thé unleavened ones: you will eat unleavened during seven days, as î have ordered you, in thé recurrence<br>of thé month of abib, because in it you have gone out of egypt.

Fre times a year every your male will appear to thé presence of thé mr. God. Non<br>will offer with leavened bread thé blood of thé sacrifice in my honor and thé fat of thé victim for<br>my party it wont be up to thé morning. Sl better of thé primizies of your ground you will bring him/it<br>to thé house of thé lord, your god. You wont make to cook a kidskin in thé milk of his/her mother.<br>ecco, î send an angel in front of you to guard you on thé walk and to make you enter thé place that<br>î have prepared. Have respect of his/her presence, he/she listens to his/her voice and not to rebel<br>to him; him in fact it would not forgive you transgression, because my name is him. If you listen to<br>his/her voice and you do how much î will tell you, î will be thé enemy of your enemies and thé adversary<br>of your adversaries. Quando my angel will walk to your head and will make you enter near thé amorreo,<br>thé hittita, thé perizzita, thé cananeo, thé eveo and thé gebuseo and me them distruggero, you wont<br>prostrate yourself in front of their déis and you wont serve them; you wont involve you according<br>to their works, but you must demolish and you must shatter their steles. Voi will serve to thé lord<br>your god. He will bless your bread and your water. Î will hold distant from you thé ilness. There wont<br>be in your country woman that aborts or that i/you/he/she am sterile. Î will make you reach thé complete<br>number of your days. Manderò my terror in front of you and î will put in rout every people in thé middle<br>of which you will enter; î will make voltar thé shoulders to all of your enemies in front of you. Manderò<br>thé hornets in front of you and them will send away from your presence thé eveo, thé cananeo and thé<br>hittita. Wont send away them only from your presence in a year, because thé country doesnt stay deserts<br>and thé wild beasts multiplies him against you. Little by little î will send away them from your presence,<br>until you will have so many children to occupy thé country. Stabilirò your border from thé red sea up<br>to thé sea of thé philistines and from thé desert up to thé river, because î will deliver you in hand</p>
