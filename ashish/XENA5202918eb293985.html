<P>As if that part of thé city was extraneous to thé turbulent existence human that had created her. After<br>all to thé bridge thé gates of thé building opened wide him for to receive them. Along thé whole avenue<br>of entry thé soldiers were lined up of thé watch of building, impeccable in thé black uniforms with<br>thé emblem of thé falcon, stiffened on thé careful ones. Rings of trumpets they announced thé arrival<br>of thé carriage. Menion was amazed: that it was thé ceremonial of welcome normally reserved to thé great<br>heads of thé four earths, a label rigidly observed by thé little monarchies remained in thé earths of<br>thé south. The pomp and thé homage of one protected military they cleary pointed out that palance buckhannah<br>was decided to not only ignore thé circumstances in which you/they had arrived, but her tradition inviolata<br>from centuries. You/he/she must be crazy: entirely crazy! Thé prince raged him of leah. It doesnt understand<br>what it is happening? We are besiged by an army invader, and he lines up thé troops for a parade! Menion,<br>must not speak so with him. And necessary a lot of patience if we want to help balinor. Shirl tightened<br>his shoulder and looked at him/it for an instant, smiling to warn him/it to him. He/she also remembers<br>what, for how much is misguided, it loves me. ONce it was good, and it is brother of balinor. Understood<br>menion that  girl was right. There was not anything from to earn to reveal his/her own irritation<br>for that stupid messinscena, and it was more wise man to favor humor of  prince until balinor<br>had not been individualized and freed. You abandoned quietly in thé carriage while it was crossing thé<br>gates of thé building, passing in magazine thé lines of impassive soldiers that formed thé elite of<br>thé personal watch of thé king. Thé fanfares continued to to echo from all thé sides and a small squadron<br>of cavalry it circled in complimentary formation to thé new arrivals. Then thé carriage he stopped and<br>thé figure of thé regent of callahorn appeared close to him/it counter, thé smiling, wneasy and happy<br>face. Shirl:shirl:have feared not to see anymore you! You stretched out verse thé carriage and it<br>helped thé girl to go down, holding her/it to him near a instant and then getting further her/it as<br>soon as to contemplate her/it. Me:i feared really to have you lost. Burning of silent anger, menion<br>went down to work and smiled weakly while palance turned him to greet him/it. Prince of leah, six really<br>thé welcome one in my kingdom. You have me rhesus: a great service. Everything that that î have is yours:<br>everything. We will be great friends, me and you! great friends! And from so much: what: you brusquely<br>interrupted, looking at thé young one losing himself/herself/itself to thé sudden one in his/her own<br>thoughts. He/she spoke jerky, as not him it perfectly realized that that it said. If it were crazy,<br>menion thought, it was certain very sick. Î am very happy to be to tyrsis he/she answered even if î<br>would have preferred that this happened in more pleasant circumstances. You allude to my brother, naturally?<br>thé question exploded while palance, red in face, it lost thé dreamy air. Menion started for thé sruprise.<br>palance, alludes to thé invasion of thé army of thé north, to thé fire of kern shirl intervened. Yes:<br>kern: again it interrupted him looking around himself/herself/itself anxiously as to thé search of someone.<br>also menion looked him around, making himself/herself/itself account that stenmin was oddly absent.<br>to how much shirl and janus senpre affirmed, thé prince was always accompained by his/her adviser. And<br>at that time he/she met him/it careful look of shirl. Something doesnt go, my gentleman? Menion him<br>he turned according to  norms of  label immediately to attract his/her attention and to seem him<br>a ready firend to help him/it. Thé stratagem had resulted unexpected. You can be of help: menion leah,<br>to me and my kingdom. My brother he/she wanted to take me thé throne. He/she wanted to make me kill.<br>my adviser stenmin has saved me: but there are other enemies: anywhere! Me and you we must be friends.<br>we must unite us against those people whom look for of to steal me thé throne: to hurt this young woman<br>that ou me you have returned. Me: i cannot talk to stenmin as î would talk to friend. But with you,<br>with you could speak! As a child, anxiously thé amazed menion leah looked, waiting for an answer. A<br>sudden sense of pity attacked thé young, that sincerely desired to be able to make something to help<br>him/it. Smiling, he/she nodded. Î knew him/it that would have taken sides with me! Thé other exclaimed,<br>laughing happy. We are both of real blood: and this is a strong bond. Friends, î and you will be great<br>menion. But now:you must rest. It seemed to suddenly remember that its watches of building were you</p>
