<P>A hand and a machine gun ingram in thé other. Before mister muscle could take thé aim and to open thé<br>fire, dan shot twice; but doc was already thrown to earth and thé second uomo thé boss, train had defined<br>him/it, to thé sight of thé rifle, him scaraventò behind thé table from billiards. Thé situation was<br>too accursedly becoming warm. Street! Dan howled to train, but train had already seen thé ingram and<br>him stava withdrawing. They launched out of thé entry of thé kitchen two pulsations of heart before<br>thé ingram started roaring. Thé wood della brings exploded in a rain of splinters. Mitch jolted when<br>he/she heard thé unmistakable voice of thé machine gun of gault. You/he/she had made to move flint and<br>pelvis putting them between itself and thé house. It had thé back it turns to thé swamp and thé hunters<br>of ransoms of forehead. Hint had seen gault pick up thé walkietalkie from thé tavolino and to murmur<br>something, after that thé man in thé tower, thé same man that to st. Nasty had him/it almost strangled<br>and you/he/she had stolen him thé derranger, you/he/she had put on thé shoulder rifle and you/he/she<br>had gone down now raggiungendo thé gangway was between thé tower and thé house. Mitch was frightened<br>to death. Droplets of sweet strained down him for does her/it, and thé hand that thé revolver tightened<br>trembled. Continuava to pass thé eyes from thé hunters of ransoms to thé house, sobbalzando to thé noises<br>of thé shootout. To thé sudden one, pelvis gasped and brought a hand to thé breast. Mitch aimed on him<br>thé gun. My god! Hint thought. Be about to have another attack! But pelvis was looking at something<br>behind thé shoulders of mitch, to shelled occhi. His/her give lips it went out a deafening cry: Non<br>sparateci! In thé same moment in which flint him made account that was thé oldest makeup of thé world,<br>and that you/he/she would not even have worked never in a million years, mitch, terrorized, he turned<br>and it shot a hit brown allacqua and to thé trees. Pelvis sank thé fist in thé temple of mitch, and<br>to thé sudden one it was on him as catrame that strains on a road. Esterrefatto, flint stayed to look.<br>pelvis stormed of fists mitch with a hand, and with thé other it immobilized him thé gun. Then thé revolver,<br>aimed toward thé aces of thé wharf, it shot another time, and flint succeeded in putting in movimento<br>legs and fists. Mitch attached with thé whole anger that had accumulato. Mitch fell in knee. Something<br>ugly to his/her face had happended. Pelvis kept on beating him/it, with thé methodicalness of whom is<br>cutting firewood for thé fireplace. Thé fingers of mitch opened, and took flint thé gun. You pass on<br>thé wood aces. Someone who raced their verse. Flint looked: thé man of thé tower was removing thé rifle<br>from thé shoulder. It was small bastard, thin, in job overall. You stopped to about ten meters of<br>distance and it shot holding thé rifle to thé height of thé sides. Flint felt him graze from thé humming<br>of a wasp incazzata. Then its turn came. Thé first hit failed. Thé second bullet centred thé man alla<br>left shoulder and thé third one few centimeters above thé heart. Thé rifle was not fallen. Thé finger<br>of thé man contracted him on thé trigger, and a pallottola sent in splinters thé windscreen of one of<br>thé two motorboats. Then thé man fell on thé aces, supine, with thé legs that continuavano to stir as<br>to beat in speed thé death. Flint didnt shoot thé last hit of thé gun. In mouth it had thé sweetish<br>taste and acido of thé putrefaction: you/he/she had never killed, and it was horrible thing. However<br>it was not thé moment to put on in knee and to ask perdono. He/she saw that thé fists of pelvis had<br>reduced thé mouth of mitch to minced carne. Pelvis grabbed for thé arm and said: enough! Pelvis looked<br>at him/it with a growl on thé lips, but it detached him from mitch. Half dead, mitch fell down to face.<br>you/they had to leave from there, and in hurry. However to cross thé swamp meant certain death for clint.<br>Flint rivoleva his/her derringer and something of other. A bracelet of metal with two keys. Keys? And<br>of thing? He/she remembered that you/he/she had been really that man to pilot thé motorboat that had<br>brought them there. Which of thé two? That to thé right, not that with thé smashed windscreen. It didnt<br>have thé palest idea of as a motorboat you are piloted, but you/he/she would be been his turn to learn<br>in hurry. Infilò thé derringer in pocket and it got up. Cecil! It screamed. So! In thé kitchen, with<br>thé braked door and thé blood that it strained from thé side of train, dan understood not to have choice.<br>go! It said. Î stop them me! A horn! Race, me no! You had died, if you dont escape. Î am dead in every</p>
