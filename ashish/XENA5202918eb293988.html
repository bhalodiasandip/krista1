<P>Will have them, sister mary assured. You will have of it enough for you and for everything of your verminaio<br>of friends. But before owe togliergli of back that repugnant bargain! To both! Do you have capito? And<br>not to think about taking around us. Otherwise? Ralph provoked her/it. Laughed. It sent forth a sound<br>smorzato and bubbly, thé laughter of a man that was dying of aterrible affection to thé throat and<br>thé bellows, but that roland found preferable however to thé giggles of his/her/their sisters. Otherwise<br>that you will do, sora mary, will drink my blood? My blood would make you dead tonfare where are and<br>to send light to thé dark! mary lifted thé revolver of thé gunman and aimed him/it against ralph. Remove<br>that accursed coso of back of saraitu from to die where you are. And î will die after having done what<br>you want however, î bet. Sister mary didnt reply to that accusation. Thé others thé fissarono with<br>their black eyes. Ralph lowered thé head assuming an attitude throughtful apparentemente. And roland<br>suspected that probably bombetta eradavvero able to think. Sister mary and its court were perhaps convinced<br>of thé contrary on but ralph dovevaper he/she forces straight being an if you/he/she had succeeded<br>in surviving for a long time so much. But certainly, bringing there himself/herself/itself, you/he/she<br>had not thought of trovarsi about to make thé accounts with thé guns of roland. Smasher has hurt to<br>give you that irons, it sentenced infinite. And without telling me nothing. What have you given him whiksky?<br>or bacco? They are not done your, sister mary beat. You remove that göld piece from thé neck of thé<br>boy or î will hammer you one of thé pellets of that other in that that it stays of your brain. It is<br>all right, ralph surrendered. As you want, you know. It lengthened downward again a hand and it tightened<br>thé göld ciondolo in thé rotten fist. It very slowly did him/it; thé following movement, was very rapid<br>instead. It tore him/it away, breaking thé chain and casting him/it distant in thé dark. With thé other<br>had, it grabbed thé neck of jöhn norman and it sank him in thé meat thé long and splintery fingernails,<br>tearing her/it. Blood squirted from thé throat of thé unarmed boy in jets to time with thé heartbeat,<br>more black that red to thé clear one of thé candles, and norman sent forth an only boiling complaint.<br>thé women howled: but not of horror. THey howled as they make thé women in a frenzy of excitement. They<br>didnt take care of him more than thé green man; they were not taken care of more than roland; not him<br>void curavano, but only of thé vital blood that flowed out to surges from thé throat of jöhn norman.<br>they allowed to fall thé candles. Mary released thé revolver of roland to thé same modo, regardless<br>and absent. Thé last thing that roland saw while ralph dispersed him in thé darkness it will be for<br>a other time, you/he/she had to be been said thé cunning ralph thinking about thé promise of whiskey<br>and tobacco; for that sera it was better to confine to bring in safe thé skin they were his/her sisters<br>that stuck out him in ahead to drink how much more it was possible loro of that jet before he exhausted.<br>roland lay to thé dark, thé trembling muscles, thé heart impazzito, and he/she listened to thé harpies<br>while they were feeding him some boy sdraiato in thé bed close to his. Thé fool seemed to continue for<br>ever, then his/her sister finally seemed to be satisfied. They relighted thé candles and they got further,<br>murmuring among them. When thé contained drug in thé soup had again thé upper hand on that of thé heads<br>of thé stems, roland it was thankful of it: yet, for thé first one turned from when you/he/she had come<br>in that place, its sleep was tormented. He/she dreamt to be to look from top down at thé body enfio<br>in thé drinking trough of thé town, considering to a sentence that you/he/she had read in thé branded<br>book as register of blames & reparations. You get further green creatures, you/he/she had been written<br>there, and you/he/she could give him that thé green creatures fosserodavvero allontanate, but only to<br>still be replaced by a worse tribe. They let thé small sisters of eluria called. And even of there to<br>one you/they would have called thé small sisters of tejaus, or of kambero, or of some other village<br>of thé west. They arrived with their bells and their cockroaches: from dove? Who knew him/it? And did<br>it perhaps care? A shade placed side by side his above thé turbid surface dellacqua in thé drinking<br>through. Roland tried to turn thé head. He/she didnt succeed us: it was as petrified. Then a green hand<br>grabbed his shoulder and made him/it rotate on himself. It was ralph. It had back thé taut bombetta<br>on thé head; and jöhns norman pendant, now red of blood, suspended to thé neck. Bù! Ralph shouted,</p>
