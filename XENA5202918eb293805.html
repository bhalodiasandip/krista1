<P>Explosive neither material inflammable, and we can exclude î reservoirs of fuel. You/they have contributed<br>To feed thé. Certain, but not in thé same measure to thé opposite extremity of thé ship. Why had<br>to every square centimeter burn with a similar intensity? Thé hall and thé superstructure are made out<br>of steel. And, besides thé pipes fireproof and to thé extinguishers, it lax had a plant of atomization.<br>you interrupted and it painted out two deformed objects of metal that hand from thé ceiling. In sea,<br>a fire usually, bursts in thé room cars, in a hold or in a store, and then it spreads from a compartment<br>to thé other, and it employs times, at times whole days to consume thé whole structure. Î am ready to<br>bet anything that an expert would be scratched thé head and would consider him/it an incendiolampo,<br>that thé whole ship has destroyed in few seconds establishing a new record, and that you/he/she has<br>been hand by causes or unknown people. And what would it have in mind, as does it cause? A flamethrower,<br>pitt responded. There was a moment of astounded silence. It realizes what is insinuating? Star is able<br>some that î realize of it, pitt loaded. Ì imagine thé violent explosive of thé flame, thé atrocious<br>hiss of thé throws, thé smoke emanated by thé burnt meat. Her likes or no, a flamethrower is thé most<br>logical explanation. All were listening to him/it with interest horror mixture. Hunnewell he allowed<br>to escape a smothered sound, as if same to omit again. It is absurd. Unthinkable, koski murmured. It<br>is everything absurd, it beat with calm pitt. Hunnewell stared at him/it. Ì cannot believe that all<br>as sheep have remained there and are allowed to turn into human torches, did it murmur, it doesn’t understand?<br>Pitt replies. Our diabolic friend has spiced or poisoned momentary î and î crew members. You/he/she<br>has probably added a thick does of hydrated cloralio in thé feeds or in thé drinks. It is also possible<br>that has shot to all how much, it commented duty. Ì have studied different dead bodies. Shock pitt thé<br>head. There were no signs of pellets or fractured bones. And if thé assassin had attended up to when<br>all had not been put out fight by thé poison and î prefer to think that they immediately are dead and<br>then you/he/she had scattered them for thé ship and you/he/she had finally gone from a compartment to<br>thé other armed with a flamethrower. Koski didn’t end thé sentence. But in this case. Where has thé assassin<br>gone? Before answering to this question, tiredly hunnewell said, î would want someone to have thé gentleness<br>to explain me as and where you/he/she was materialized, so much to start. It is evident that it was<br>not a passenger and it didn’t belong to thé crew. It laxera departed with fifteen men on board and you/he/she<br>has burnt with fifteen men. According to thé logic, this slaughter is work fo a team arrived with another<br>ship. But doesn’t have sense! Koski exclaimed. Because a ship can board another of it devesserci a contact<br>radio. Even if it tax had taken on board î supposed survivors of a false shipwreck, thé commander you/he/she<br>would immediately have signalled him. Then smiled. It î don’t remember badly, thé last message sent by<br>fyrie concerned thé looking of a suite to thé attic of thé statler hilton in new york. Poor thing, it<br>murmured duty. If thé wealth and thé success must bring to an end of thé kind, to what they serve? Ì<br>looked you stay that lay on thé bridge and it dissuaded in hurry thé look. My god, what kind of manioc<br>you/he/she could have killed fifteen human beings all in once? Who could methodically have poisoned<br>fifteen men for then to incinerate then with a flamethrower? Thé same type of crazy person that makes<br>thé airplanes of line explode for boxing thé insurance, pitt explained. An individual able to kill another<br>human being with thé same indifference with which she would kill a fly. In this case, thé motive is<br>clear it was thé interest. Fyrie and his/her î had made a discovery of enormous value. Thé united states<br>wanted her/it, russia wanted her/it, but somebody else has appropriated. And was it worth to do everything<br>this? Hunnewell asked with an expression disgusted in thé eyes. Yes, for thé sixteenth man. Pitt lowered<br>thé look on thé grisly rests that lay on thé bridge. Thé non recorded intruder that has killed all thé<br>others. Iceland, earth of ices and fire, of tormented glaciers and of smoking volcanoes, a red island<br>prism of it washes, green of tundra and blue of lakes, he extended under thé gilded light of thé sun<br>of midnight. Surrounded by thé atlantic ocean, bandaged by thé lukewarm waters of thé tide of thé south<br>gulf and from thé icy polar sew to north, Iceland is found road to half between new york and Moscow.<br>It is a strange island, from thé extraordinary landscape, very cold than you are thought: on thé southern</p>
