<P>He goes to look for. Lugantes made grimace. That man is dangerous height. It is ambitious, and he/she<br>doesnt know him/it. Mr Rolon tightened him in thé shoulders. It is all right. Î will beware me of him,<br>but to dream in this way and not to have confort. It laced thé surrounded one and it lifted thé braccias<br>for wool ilcamisado, engerly throwing him/it to him above thé disheveled head. In search of goats! My<br>father will be delighted of it. You/he/she has always disired that me impegnassi in something. It coughed<br>for hiding thé due embarrassment to thé blame towards his/her father. Î dont intend with this to say<br>niente of disloyal toward thé crown, lugntes. Absolutely, height! It quickly appeared of accord lugantes.<br>you dont find here you for disloyalty, but because your majesty soffre of attacks of anger. And that<br>doesnt even men disloyalty toward thé crown. Nobody to court believes that your behaviours and disloyal.<br>unwise at times, but disloyal never. Rolon inserted thé doublet, quarreling with thé gorgiera to do<br>yes that thé end not premised on thé neck, then takings thé sleeves. It uses thé steel pins lugantes.<br>There is not nmotive to wear here some jewels. You/he/she could not confess that he/she preferred to be<br>less fluorescent than it allowed his life of court. Î want some simple leather gloves, nothing of elaborate.<br>very sensible, height. It drew near to thé greatest some two trunks that rolon had brought with itself<br>and it looked for thé desired gloves, mostrandoli to thé real infant that was finising to tap thé sleeves<br>to thé doublet. There is other? My ring, and î am ready. Taken thé ring and he/she remained a disorientated<br>momento, as if thé same putting back equally of thé preceding night. Once more owed check thé fredda,<br>nauseating feeling that invaded him/it and, when you/he/she was passed, he/she didnt succeed in remembering<br>her/it enough to discover its cause. Its laughter was not convinced. You are right for thé wine. It<br>is not impossible, lagautes said with calm, but with a wriggle in thé intelligent eyes. Î must do more<br>attention tonight, or. It settled thé hand and he/she saw that thé fingernails were broken and jagged,<br>and that thé fingers were sudicie. Thing?. Laguntes. It was about to show thé hands to thé minstrel,<br>when you/he/she was taken by an irrational fear. Hands me thé basin: î should wash my hands before inserting<br>thé gloves. Its ears had gathered thé nervousness and thé sadness that waved in its voce, but not lugantes<br>apparently hastened. Immediately, height. But î fear that water is cold. Raced nearby in thé room and<br>taken carafe and basin from above an old chest. It was unforgivable to forget of a service so fundamental.<br>he/she knew to be bortunate that thé young one had not reproached him that mistake, and it held her/it<br>a further test of thé innata humanity of don rolon and his/her royal courtesy. Bringing thé objects<br>in thé bedroom said: î will ask that in thé future water is heated if you desire him/it height. It wont<br>be necessary, distractedly rolon responded. Not riusciva to guess as you/he/she had been able to be<br>reduced thé hands in that modos. Where had you/he/she been for breaking thé fingernails, if you he/she<br>had not dug for earth? It looked for in thé memory, but uselessly. You remembered vagamente a similar<br>situation around one month before, when you/he/she went to visit thé gipsy ones under thé boundaries<br>of valladolid. Also then its hands were sudicie and it had thé torn suits: you/he/she had thought about<br>having had more adventures of how much he/she remembered of it, but now. You are worried, height? Churches<br>lugantes, reading thé an goscia in thé dark eyes of thé young one. Eh? Risollevò brusquely thé look.<br>no, î am not preoccupato. Î thought. Dipped thé hands in thé water and it rubbed her in hurry, without<br>bewaring too much of near what it washed away of it. Other serves you? Churches lagantes. Besides ciro,<br>naturally. Ciro eje was thé valet of don rolon, a twenty yearold practical and amible youth, coming<br>from a list family diconversos that had not forgotten his/her own heritage giudaico yet. Ciro honored<br>grandparents and greatgrandfathers, despite you/they were held hostile of thé church, and you/he/she<br>was often boasted that his/her more uncle anzianos you/he/she had belonged to thé crew of thé genoese<br>cristoforo colombo when for thé first timie you/he/she was set sail toward thé new mondo. Ciro eje was<br>one of thé few servants that were stopped to discutere seriously with lugantes. Ciro would be of help,<br>but you are dearly getting by, lugantes, sadly don rolon said. Soon you will return to valladolid, height,<br>and you will more adequately have served there. Ciro will be aghast seeing how î have treated your suits,<br>but it is a comprehensive man: it wont become angry too much with me. It made spallucce. A minstrel </p>
