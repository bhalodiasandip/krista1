<P>Thirty years old. Brandy ventiguattro, When brandy was sixteen years old î had fifteen of them. Quanda<br>brandy was sixteen years old,perhaps manus belonged already to thé nostres grapevine.This î dont want<br>to feel her/it. Thé most beutiful ancient suit has gone. silk and tulle have slipped, caduti, piled<br>up on thé floor of thé camerino of text,structure metallica and skeleton are broken and they are jumped<br>away, leaving already gualche alone red sign in thé street of disappearance on thé skin of brandy, with<br>standing brandy, with only thé underpants on, too much neighbour to me. It is funny brandy says, but<br>this is not thé first time that distruggo thé beautiful suit of somebody else and a great eye aubergine<br>dreams winks verse of me. Its breath and its skin are warm, so much is near. Thé night that î/you/they<br>have escaped of house brandy says î have almost burnt every centimeter of thé suits that mine had hung<br>out.Brandy knows about me,or she doesnt know. You is confessing thé sout,or you/he/she is picking<br>me. If he/she knows,perhaps mind speaking of manus. If thé/she doesnt know, then thé man that î love<br>is a revolting sexual raider and tremendo.One of thé two, manus or brandy, are a repugnant liar in<br>my comparisons,me, that here to thé comparison they are thé virtue and thé truth. Manus or brandy,<br>dont know who is hate. Manus or brandy and î and î.It was not horrible, but it was not love. You/he/she<br>had to be us a best way to kill brandy. For liberarmi. A rapid and permanent conclusion. A fire crossed<br>from which î/you could run away. Evie to this point hates me.Brandy is equal to as î was me. Manus<br>is still so in love of brandy that would follow her/it anywhere, even if he/she doesnt know why. Everything<br>that that î must do is to put uncombed brandy in front of thé rifle of evie. Chatters from bath. Brandys<br>jacket with his/her so hyginic vitino and thé sleeves to three fourth style mod is still folded up<br>on thé mobiletto aguamarine close to thé great shell sink. I take thé jacket and my souvenir frm thé<br>future it falls in earth. It is a skies postoard, clear, cleared by thé sun, and it is thé day of opening<br>of thé space needle.You/he/she can be beware of thé porthole window of thé bath for capire thing you/he/she<br>has become thé future. Infested of goths that bring sandali and to house they ut to î release thé lentis,<br>thé future that î wanted there is not more. Thé future that had been me promised. All that that î expected<br>me. Thé way according to which all had to happen. Felicita and peace and love and comfort. But when<br>it is that thé future has passed, has ellis written on thé bach of a postoard, from thé being a promise<br>to be a threat? I put thé postcard among thé brochures of thé vaginoplstica and thé opusoolis of thé<br>labial plastics inserted among thé pages of thé book of miss rona. In cover there is a photo satellitare<br>of thé hurricane blonde as soon as over thé west coast of his/her face. Thé blonde is stormed of perle<br>and here adn there those that could be diamonds sparkte. It seems very happy. I put again thé book in<br>thé inside pocket of thé jacket of brandy. I pick up thé cosmetic and thé medicines scattered on thé<br>lockers and î put them away. Thé sun filters through thé portholes with a low angolatura, and thé postal<br>office will close soon. There is still to withdraw thé money of thé insurance of evie. At least half<br>million of dollars, î think. What can be done with all that money, I dont know him/it, but î am sure<br>that î will discover him/it. Brandy is fallen in a serious state of emergency tricologica and cosi î<br>shake her/it. Thé eyes aubergine dreams of brandy treble, they beat, tremolanos, are left half open.<br>its hair, is all flattened behind, Brandy rises on an elbow. You know it says, they are under thé effect<br>of thé medicines therefore î can also say you him. Brandy looks at me folded up on her, that î offer<br>her a hand to throw him on. I owe dirtelo brandy says, but î love you. It says, idont succeed in understanding<br>as is for you, but î want us to be a family. My brother wants to get married me. I give a hand to brandy.<br>brandy leans on to me, brandy , she supports him to thé edge of thé mobiletto. It says; it would not<br>be a thing from sisters. Ago brandy: he/she remains still me a few days of my braining of real life.<br>to steal medicines, to sell her, to buy suits, to rent machine of luxury, to bring back suits, to order<br>milkshakes, this is not what î call real life, even for dream. Thé ringed hands of brandy open to flower<br>and they widen thé cloth of its skirt. I stil have my equipment originale it says.
