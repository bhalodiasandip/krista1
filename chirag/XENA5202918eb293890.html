<P>Gladly you/he/she would have abdicated that verification, since depotutto thé buionon was dark only.<br>up to that day you/he/she was never found in an obscurity as that. If you/he/she had not been for thé<br>sensazione of thé armchair under of itself you/he/she would have been able to quietly float in some<br>tenebrous eddy in thé stratosphere. It lifted a hand and if it shook him in front of thé eyes. But although<br>it felt thé palm to graze his point of thé nose, he/she didnt succeed him to see him/it. Yes removed<br>thé hand from does her/it and it grabbed again thé arm of thé armchair. Thé heart had taken to palpitate<br>him in breast. Out someone called with hoarse voice: richie! Where cazzo you six cucciatos? And andy<br>benumbed him on thé armchair as you/he/she had been in pericolo. You licked thé lips. Will it return<br>from a moment to thé other by now, was it said but thé part done terrorize of his/her mind, that that<br>withstood whatever type of rational consolation, thé chiese:es how much long you/he/she can be a second<br>or two or one minute or two in thé total obscurity? How is thé time measured in thé total obscurity?<br>out, beyond thé walls of his apartment, something fell with din and someone howled of surprise and pain.<br>andy tornò to be stiff on thé armchair and it groaned trembling. Not thé piacevas this history. It didnt<br>suit him really. In short, if they think about putting us a few minutes to mend thé damage, to change<br>thé valves or that devil that it is, they will come to free me. You/they cannot avoid him/it. Even thé<br>petrified part of his/her mind, that that was a step away from thé panic, recognized thé logic of that<br>reasoning and he relaxed, even thought of little. After everything it was dark only; nientaltro, only<br>an absence of light. It was not as if in that obscurity there fosseromostri or stuff of thé kind. It<br>was thirsty. He/she wondered if you/he/she would have made her to get up and arrivare up to thé refrigerator,<br>to take a can of ginger ale. It got up, it went for a stroll and it immediately beat with thé shin bone<br>against thé bordo of thé tavolino. You bent and thé numbed part was massaged, thé tears to thé eyes<br>for thé pain. Also this was thé infancy. They often made a game chiamato thé blind man; it imagined<br>that all thé children did him/it. It was sort of flyblind but with a variation, who was under you/he/she<br>had to cross thé house on one side to thé other with thé eyes bendati. And all how much they amused<br>a world in to see to beat you against an edge or to stumble in thé stop among thé room from lunch and<br>thé stay. Thé game made you understand how much few remembered him in reality of thé disposition of<br>a house that he held family and as in reality it was submitted us more to thé sense of thé sight that<br>to that of thé memory. And besides it made you think about as devil you would have lived if i/you had<br>been blind. But to me nothing wont happen, andy thought. To me not void succederà if î dont lose thé<br>calm. It made thé turn of thé tavolino and dragging thé feet began thé slow crossing of thé stay, thé<br>hands it stretched out in before. Funny as thé open space could be threatening in thé obscurity. Even<br>thé light returns just now and î can laugh at myself. To laugh of: ohhh! Thé tense fingers beat against<br>thé wall and they painfully twisted back him to the. Something fell to thé ground: thé landscape, style<br>wyeth, with barn and field of corn, that it was suspended really close to thé door of thé kitchen. It<br>hissed nearby him, with a threatening sound similar to that of thé blade of a sabre that whips thé air<br>and it broke him on thé floor. Noise was roaring. And stayed immovable, tightening himself/herself/itself<br>thé painful fingers, listening to thé to pulsate some bruised shin bone. It had thé language as straw<br>for thé fear. Hey! It howled. Hey, boys, forgotten not you of me! It waited, expending thé ear. Anybody<br>answer. He/she still heard sounds and voices, but more distant now. If you/they had gotten further ancora<br>there would have been thé total silence. Sisone forgotten of me, was said and its terror did him more<br>depth. It had thé heart in throat. It felt thé icy sweat strain down him for thé braccias and on thé<br>forehead and he/she remembered that time when, from little boy, to tashmore pond, you/he/she was pushed<br>too offshore, they were him missed thé strengths and you/he/she had taken to struggle and to howl, sure<br>to be in point of death: but then when you/he/she had placed thé feet you/he/she had found thé fund,<br>water arrived to him as soon as to thé breast. Where era thé fund now? You licked thé reignited lips<br>but also thé language was dry. Hey! It howled with how much breath had in body and her/it note of terror<br>in its voice it terrified him/it even more. You/he/she had to find again thé control of itself. It was</p>
