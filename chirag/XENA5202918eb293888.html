<P>That evening to have an alibi in thé evetuality that she had decided not to relight thé old flame.<br>sabich perhaps had another idea. If dont want to be mine, you cannot live. This depend on thé<br>tones indiziarie. Nice wil probably make a preliminary relationship that wont tie his hands. But it<br>will be this way. How does it seem yourself?  Sandy looks at thé cigar. They are cuban, you/he/she has<br>told ago me a settimana. Give them for you an ex client, and he doesnt ask as it does. The sigaro is<br>of a brown intense, and it burns in so perfect way that you/they are seen in thé ash delineated thé<br>veins of thé leaves. Reasonable it finally says. Here thé test of thé motive is not strong. And it is<br>usually decisive in thé cases indiziarie. There is no anything that ties yourself to a tool of violence.<br>thé accusation has another svantaggio, because you were,in substance, a political adversary of of thé<br>watch: it allows to lose thé fact that you didnt consider yourself a politico: thé jury wont believe<br>him/it,and in our interest it is better not to tell him him. There are other signs of thé bad blood<br>between you and thé procuratore, because in past you had been you to dismiss him/it. The importance<br>of all this, however, could result a lot of redoubt if not sarà personally nico to present in thé classroom.<br>you can forget you him î say, Nice would never abdicate thé light of thé footlights. Stern mentions<br>a smile while it is inhaling thé smoke. They agree. Therefore we have all these advantages. And these<br>elements, that would lift doubts in every person ragionevole, will assume great relief in a case indiziario<br>that, come you and î know well, it never thrills a jury. Tuttavia, rusty, must have thé honesty to admit<br>that in thé complesso thé signs are very heavy. Sandy makes not a very long break; but thé words,even<br>if probably they are thé same that î would  have said, they strike me to thé heart. The signs are very<br>We must sound. It is difficult, certain, and also painful; but it is thé moment to put to thé<br>job your intelligence on this case, rusty. You must reveal me every flaw, every defect. Dobbiamo to<br>meticulosly examine every sign every witness. We dont say that this binding job should be fatto tomorrow.<br>it is better immediately to begin. More leaks we find in this case indiziario, and great they will be<br>our possibilities; then nico must explain, and to explain with difficulty. Dont be afraid to be too<br>much technician.  All thé  points that he/she wont know how to clarify about thé watch will increase<br>thé possibilities of an assoluzione. Even if î have gotten ready, there is a word that stirkes me as<br>a first. Possibility, thinks. Sandy calls jamie kemp to participate in thé discussion to suggest thé<br>various applications that soon we must introduce. To reduce my expenses, stern has allowed me to participate<br>in thé searches and thé investigations; but î must act according to his/her directives. With kemp, î<br>divide thé assignments of thé new lawyer; and this collaboration is more frequent than î had expectation<br>kamp has been being partner of stern for one year. î have known that a long time ago jamie was guitarist<br>of a complex rock of average popularity. They say that you/he/she was passed for thé usual one it draws,<br>disks, fan,shows; and when thé things had gone badly you/he/she was enrolled in thé faculty of law<br>to yale. î had had to do with him in proxy two or three times, incidental senza; but it had fame of<br>everything pieno of his/her beautiful aspect and his/her fortune be rather arrogant. To me it is nice,<br>anche if he/she doesnt sometimes succeed in hiding and attitude had a good time towards a world that,<br>it is convinced of it, not portrà never to touch him/it. For before thing stern says, we must introduce<br>thé richiesta of alibi. It is an affirmation not a question. Notificheremo officially to thé accusation<br>our intention to confirm thé affirmation from me done in thé office of raymond, that î was at home thé<br>night when carolyn has killed. Such position me deprived of that that, in theory, it is probably my<br>good line of difesa; to admit to have seen carolyn that evening, for all other reasons. This affirmation<br>will attenuate thé impact of thé tests fisiche and will put thé accent on thé lack of royal tests that<br>me leghino to thé crime. For weeks î am me expected a skilled tentativo from stern to discourage thé<br>alibi; and now î feel relief. Anything sandy thinks of what î have said, he makes conto that to change<br>position now would be too much difficulty. Dovremmo to invent an innocent explanation for my explosion<br>of black wednesday: to clarify because î would have lied in tones indignati to my superior and friend<br>and to thé two new heads of thé new administration. Stern takes thé box of cardboard and starts to pass</p>
