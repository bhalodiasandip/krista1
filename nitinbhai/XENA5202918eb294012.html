<P>As we will have what we have come to look for. Pitt set out toward thé door. You went go to any place<br>for next hour and a half, sandecker stopped him/it. We still have quite a lot time. It is soon. It doesnt<br>have sense misuse of his/her physical resources. It knows better thé charts of thé repetitive immersions<br>of anybody else sub to the world. Two immersions to quarantaquattro meters in thé turn of mezzora almost<br>inevitably involve an embolism. After a brief break, taken back, to lower voice: you/he/she has seen<br>many men howl for thé suffering. It knows those that have survived and those that it you/they have been<br>paralyzed for thé whole life. Even if Î pushed at thé most this barge,Î could not reach reykjavik in<br>less than two hours. Adds other five hours on board of a jet for london and for thé nearest room of<br>decompression. Nothing to be done, my friend. Sottocoperta and rests goes. I will tell you hime me, when<br>you/he/she can bathe again. Î surrender me admiral. Pitt made to flow thé lightning of thé molt. But<br>Î believe that it would be better if Î lay down me on thé bridge. This way all and three will be visible.<br>and who should see us! The coast is desert, and we has not met another boot from when we have left the<br>Î bring. The coast is not desert. There is an observer. Sandecker turned him to look at thé bluff. I<br>am perhaps growing old, but Î dont need thé glasses yet, and comes me an accident if Î see something.<br>it is on thé right behind thé rock that sticks out from thé water. To this distance Î dont succeed in <br>seeing a horn. Thé admiral cost a glance toward thé point pointed out by pitt. If Î took thé binoculars<br>and Î looked, it would be as if Î spied through thé hole of a lock and Î saw another eye. How does it<br>do to be so sure? Î have seen a reflex.Thé sun has flashed on something for an instant. Probably a<br>couple of lenses. You leave that they look. If someone had to ask because we were alone in two on thé<br>bridge, we will explain that tidi suffered from sea sickness and you/he/she was laid down on a berth<br>sottocoperta. You/he/she can be a good excuse, Pitt said with a smile. Provided that doesnt succeed<br>in understanding thé difference between me and tidi, despite thé ridiculous attire. Laughed sandecker.<br>with a binoculars to a kilometer and a half of distance, not even his/her mother would not be able to<br>gather thé difference. Î dont know indeed as to interpret this comment. Sandecker  turned him to look<br>at him/it in thé eyes, and ironically smiled. I/you/he/she dont even try us. And now you spin sottocoperta.<br>it is thé time of thé nap. Î will send tidi tobring her a cup of coffee. And you dont  try to make jokes.<br>Î know that it is excited after a problematic immersion. A strange greyish light entered from thé hatch<br>when shaken sandecker pitt. You slowly woke up, with thé confused mind, stunned as by thé rap you/he/she<br>would have been able to stun him/it a sleep of eight hours. Then it noticed that thé movement of thé<br>waves was reduced it grimsi stirred as soon as, and thé breeze was fallen. Thé air was damp and heavy.<br>thé time is changed, admiral? A bench of upcoming fog from south. When? Among about twenty minutes at<br>thé most. It is not a lot. It is enough. Enough for a brief immersion. Shortly time, pitt again wore<br>thé molt and thé equipment and lowered him in water. Ridiscese in a world where sounds neither winds<br>there were not, where thé air didnt exist. It emphatically kicked with thé fins and it continued toward<br>thé fund. Î muscles were cold and numbed, thé brain still benumbed by thé sleep. It swam in silence,<br>without effort as if you/he/she was suspended to a thread. It swam in thé middle. of thé colors that<br>darkened him thé verdazzurro slowly turned him into a grey slim. It didnt have thé senseof thé orientation<br>anymore, but only thé signs furnished from thé instinct and from thé points of reference on thé backdrop.<br>then it found him/it. Thé heart started to beat him as a grancassa while it was cautiously drawing near<br>to thé airplane. He/she knew for experience that, when you/he/she had entered thé wreckage, every movement<br>would have been dangerous. It reached Î tear him/it some fuselage, a pair of meters away from thé wings,<br>toward thé tail, and you/he/she ws welcomed by a small sea sebaste, a longer fish of a two weeks of<br>centimeters. Thé orange squames clerly opposed with Î break down him/it dark and, in the weak light,<br>thé little animal seemed an ornament for thé tree of christmas. Thé fish stared at pitt for a moment<br>with a round eye set under thé thorny head, therefore you/he/she darted him before while he entered<br>thé airplane. Not as soon as it gotused to thé obscarity, pitt was seen a chaos of seats divelti and<br>to wood boxes that floated against thé ceiling. It pushed two boxes toward thé opening and he/she remained</p>
