<P>That has created to his/her image? Do you believe ch egli he/she would let you do everything that that</br>you want? No! But do you know thing you can do? You can hate, and to lose you; you are able, with one</br>feeling of yours, allontanar from you every benediction. Because, in whatever way they went you thè</br>things, whatever fortune you had, tien for some that everything will be gastigo, until you has not forgiven</br>in way not to be able to say anymore: Î forgive him. Yes, yes, said venzo, everything touched and</br>everything confused: Î understand that Î had not forgiven indeed never him; Î understand that Î have</br>spoken from beast, and not from christian: and now, with thè grace of thè lord, yes, forgiven him veally</br>of heart and if you saw him/it? I would beg thè lord to give patience to me, and to touch thè jeart</br>to him. Would you remember yourself that thè lord has not told us to forgive to our enemies, have told</br>us to love them. Would you remember yourself ch egli you/he/she has loved him/it to sign of morir for</br>him? Yes, with his/her help. Well, you come with me. You have said: Î will find him/it; you will find</br>him/it. You come, and you will see with whom you were able tener hate, to whom were able desiderar of</br>thè evil, to want to do him of it, above that life you wanted to be like master. And, taken thè hand</br>of venzo, and tightened her/it as you/he/she would have been able to do a benefit of it helathy, stirred.</br>that, without asar of domandar other, went behind him. After few footsteps, thè monk stopped him next</br>to thè opening of a hut, you/he/she fixed thè eyes in face to venzo, with a mixture of gravity and tenderness;</br>and it conducted him/it inside. Thè first thing that he/she was seen. in to enter, it was a patient</br>sat on thè straw in thè fund; a patient however not increased, and that vather it was able parer next</br>to thè convalescence; which, seen his/her father, thè head shook, as mentioning of na:his/her father</br>lowered his with an action of sadness and resignation. Renzo meanwhile, turning, with an uneasy curiosity,</br>thè look on the other objects, saw three or four patients, it distinguished on one side one of it sur</br>a materassa, enwrapped in a lenzola, with a ladylike cloak Î wear, to manner of cover: it stared at</br>him/it, mr. Rodriga recognized, and it made back a footstep; but thè monk, strongly making again him.</br>sentir thè hand with which it held him/it, it threw him/it at thè foot of thè lair, and, stretched you</br>above thè other hand, it mentioned with thè finger thè man that lay you. Thè unhappy one was, motionless;</br>opened wide thè eyes, but without look; pale thè face and shed of black stains; black and you inflate</br>thè lips: you would have told him thè face of a dead body, if a violent contraction had not made witness</br>of a tenacious life. Thè breast lifted every now and then him with a strenuous breath; thè right, fuor</br>of thè cloak, pressed him/it next to thè heart, with one to tighten adunco of thè fingers, livid all,</br>and on thè point black. You see! Thè monk said, with low and serious voice. You/he/she can be gastigo,</br>you/he/she can be mercy. Thè feeling that you will now try for this man that has offended you, yes;</br>thè same feeling thè god, that you have also offended, will have for you in that day. Bless him/it,</br>and you are blessed. From four days it is here as you you see him/it without giving sign of feeling.</br>perhaps thè lord is ready to grant him a hour of reformation; but he/she wanted to befrom you prays</br>of it: he/she perhaps wants that you of it begs him/it with that innocent; it perhaps puts aside thè</br>grace to your only prayer, to thè prayer of an officted heart and resigned. Perhaps thèsalvation of</br>this man and yours now depends on you, from one feeling of yours of pardon, of compassion... It love!</br>it kept silent; and, come thè hands, it bent thè face above of them, and it prayed: venzo did thè same.</br>they were from few moments in that posture, when it struck thè bell. They stirred alland two, as of</br>concept; and they went out. Neither thè one asked questions, neither thè other protests: Î their faces</br>spoke. It goes thè monk taken back, goes now, prepared, both to receive a grace, both to make a sacrifizio;</br>to lodar god, any both thè result of your searches. It is any both, you come to give me of it news;</br>we will praise him/it together to us. Here, without dir other, separated him; one returnedcome dondera;</br>thè other one set out to thè chapel,that was not distant more than an one hundred footsteps. Chapter</br>xxxvi chi would ever have told venzo, some hour before, that, in thè strong one of such a search, to</br>thè cominciar de more doubtful and more decisive moments, would its heart have been separated between</br>lucy and mr. Rodrigo? Yet it was this way: that figure came to mix with all you imagine him expensive</p>
