<P>warn my tutor and to ask to inform him my insegnantis: î had indeed two of it or three scabby and<br>wanted to avoid retaliations to have jumped their lessons. Then î thrusted a change of suits in the<br>backpack, î added the mia introdugiance to the philosophy fall of cars, and î departed. Of there to a<br>week î would have abandoned the course, in which î was being all right. That night my<br>world changed, it chaged a lot, and in my book of hilosopy î dednt find agything of suitable<br>world changed, it chaged a lot, and in my600 Rs. of philosophy î dodat fond of suitable to <br>that combiamentes. î had reached to understand that there are some things under, and î confirm the concept<br>under, and there is no book that explains what î am. I believe that in certain cases is worthwhile to<br>forget that î am there. If he is able, naturally. From the vallabhof the maince of orono to lewiston.<br>nella country of androscoggin there is centottanta chilometri8 and the most repid way to curer it is as<br>Her the. Thé  highway however it is not the best artery for an antoscoppi the road police regularly<br>Ranting away to kicks all hose that it finds. Also one who he is semplicemente stopped on a ramp of<br>access. And if the sterso cop pecks at twice yourself, you/h/she is easy that i/you/he/she yourself<br>arche a fine. This way me taken the route, that that goes down from bangor towardsouthwest. It is<br>a beaten road, and if you dont have really does her/it from mad you usually have good probabilities<br>to find a passage. Besides the cops leave there normally you alone. I did the first one it couers together<br>with a gloomy assicuratore that brought me up to newport. I stopped for about twenty minutes to the<br>intersection with the route, then î found a passage from an elderly gentleman that he was going to<br>bowdoinham. It drove keeping on looking through him among the legs. It was as if same trying to stop<br>something that wagged him inside the underpants. My wife has always told that if îcontinued to tirar<br>on hitchhikers one day or the other one î ended in a fosso with a knife in the back, you/he/she confided<br>me. But when î see a firm boy on the eyelash of the road, they always come me to mind the days of my<br>gioventù. î made to go that thumb to more î am not able, allora. And î also raced on the put make up<br>on automobiles. Now it looks at some, she is dead from four years and me î an alive and flourishing<br>ancora, to the steering wheel of the same old usual dodge. And a country house misses me. You scratched.<br>among the legs. Where you are directed, son? î told him that î went to lewiston and because. It is terrible<br>it commented him. Yours but ! regret so much me ! Its compassion was so strong and spontaneous that<br>got me a prickle to the angle of the eyes. I beat the eyelids to reject the tears. î didnt have any<br>desire to burst to cry in the old trabiccolo of that man, that rattled and it rolled and it stinked<br>quite a lot than piss. Mrs. mc curdy, that that has called me, has said that it is not serious. My mother<br>is still young, you/he/she has only fortyeight years. But says that has had a hit ! It was sincerely<br>dismay. You scratched again the horse loosened of the green calzonis clawing him/it to him with the<br>old man manona. A hit is always serious! Son, would bring you to the ospedale me same, î would unload<br>you home, you know, if not promised aversi to my brother ralph to bring him/it above to the aspirio<br>of gates. His/her wife is us, you/he/she has that illness that makes you forget the thing you/he/she<br>doesnt come me to mind as you/he/she calls, anderson or aloares, something of the kind. algheimer,<br>î helped him/it. Oh already you/he/she is also coming probably to me. But î almost almost bring you<br>as the same. There is no need, î answered. To gates î will find facilmente a passage. However, it said<br>him. Your mother~ A hit ! Quarantottanni only! you grabbed the horse of the pants. I am encircles some<br>malora! It exclaimed and then laughed, a toward that you/he/she ws despaired together and had a good<br>time. This hernia of the caggo! If the throws for the long ones, son, all the fitting start to go to<br>make fottere. At the end god takes you to kicks in culo, allow to tell him/it.  However you are a big<br>good boy to release everything to race from her as you are doing. It is a good mother, î beat and again<br>î warned the burning of the tears. î never had a lot of nostalgia of house when î was to the university,<br>an alone pochino the first week, but it came at that time.
